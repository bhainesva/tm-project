Level 3 Communications Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Storey has returned to work after a medical leave to recuperate from surgery related to a heart condition.

Storey has resumed all duties and responsibilities, the Broomfield, Colorado-based communications provider said Wednesday in a statement.

Storey was promoted to the CEO job in 2013 after about five years as chief operating officer. He’s a longtime telecommunications industry executive, with stints at Leucadia Telecommunications Group, WilTel Communications, Cox Communications Inc. and Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.

Level 3 is one of the largest companies used by Internet services including Netflix Inc. and Google Inc. to route traffic across the Web.

Sunit Patel, Level 3’s chief financial officer, had served as interim CEO while Storey was on leave.
