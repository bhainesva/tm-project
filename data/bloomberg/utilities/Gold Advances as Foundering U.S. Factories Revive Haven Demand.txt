Disappointing U.S. economic data is once again giving gold a lift.

Gold futures rose for the first time in three sessions as reports Friday showed manufacturing output unexpectedly declined in March by the most since February 2015, while consumer confidence fell in April to the weakest in seven months. The dollar fell against a basket of 10 major currencies.

The lower-than-expected U.S. figures helped revive demand for gold, which had dissipated this month as signs of a resilient American expansion helped dent the metal’s appeal as a haven. Bullion capped its best quarter since 1986 in March amid financial-market tumult and concerns over the outlook for global economic growth at the start of the year.

“Weaker-than-expected U.S. industrial data with lower revisions and a slide in sentiment has helped buttress the gold price,” said Tai Wong, the director of commodity products trading at BMO Capital Markets in New York.

Gold futures for June delivery rose 0.7 percent to settle at $1,234.60 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New York, trimming this week’s loss to 0.7 percent. The metal has fallen 0.1 percent in April, after jumping 17 percent last quarter.

Total industrial production, including mines and utilities, slumped by a weaker-than-estimated 0.6 percent for a second month, a Federal Reserve report showed Friday. The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index for this month fell to 89.7, the lowest since September, from 91 in March.

Silver futures gained on the Comex. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, palladium futures advanced while platinum slipped.
