Prudential Financial Inc.’s money management business chief says he sees no reason why the U.S. company can’t boost Japanese assets under management by more than a trillion yen ($9.1 billion) a year.

“We are going to continue to invest significantly in the Japanese market,” said David Hunt, the chief executive officer of PGIM, the new name for Prudential’s asset management business, in an interview. “I would certainly like to see us continue what has been a kind of a growth of between 10 percent and 15 percent in our assets here.”

PGIM’s Japanese investment management business oversaw about 18.2 trillion yen of assets at the end of last year, according to the company. The adoption by the Bank of Japan of negative interest rates will probably force more institutions in the world’s third-largest economy to invest in higher-yielding foreign products, according to Hunt.

The unit of the second-biggest U.S. life insurer will also add staff in sales and asset management areas as it goes after more business in the nation, according to Hunt. The money manager has more than 100 staff in Japan, including about 80 at Prudential Investment Management Japan, he said.

“We are very optimistic about the next couple of years, so we will continue to add people” in Japan, he said. “We have got the sweet spot between broader fixed income, credit, a huge real estate business, as well real estate bonds.”

PGIM managed $963 billion of assets globally at the end of 2015.
