Both pilots in a chartered-jet crash last year in Akron, Ohio, that killed seven employees of a Florida real estate company had been fired from previous jobs for performance issues, investigators said Wednesday.

All nine people aboard the Hawker 125-700A died Nov. 10 when it struck an apartment building and burst into flames as the flight crew attempted to land in poor visibility, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. The plane descended below safe levels and got too slow, according to preliminary information released by the NTSB.

The two pilots, who weren’t identified in NTSB records, had each been terminated from previous jobs. The captain, 40, was fired April 30, 2015, for failing to attend required training, according to NTSB records. The copilot, 50, was fired Feb. 27, 2015, for “unsatisfactory work performance,” according to the NTSB.

Under U.S. aviation regulations, the employment records of commercial pilots must be reviewed before they are hired.

The plane was a charter fight operated by Execuflight. It was carrying executives of Boca Raton-based Pebb Enterprises LLC, described on its website as a private equity real estate investment company specializing in commercial properties.

The reports released Wednesday by the NTSB contain basic factual findings. The agency hasn’t yet concluded the cause of the accident.
