U.K. authorities attempting to investigate the so-called “Panama Papers” leak have a dilemma: they haven’t seen the files.

The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority hasn’t been given access to the a cache of data leaked from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, FCA head of enforcement Mark Steward said Wednesday at a London conference. Serious Fraud Office Director David Green, also speaking on the panel, said the files "are being and will be accessed" without clarifying whether the agency actually had them.

The U.K. authorities involved, which include the National Crime Agency and HM Revenue & Customs, are still waiting for the data.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists led reporting on the leak of a huge trove of documents earlier this month that revealed how Mossack Fonseca allegedly set up shell companies to help heads of state and international criminals conceal their riches. The scandal has shed light on how some of the world’s wealthiest people have channeled billions through offshore accounts, raising questions about tax evasion and money laundering.

Banks and other financial companies were asked to disclose any ties to Mossack Fonseca to the FCA by April 15. Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS Group AG are among a number of banks that have been reported as helping to create offshore shell companies for world leaders, athletes and other rich clients.

We "haven’t seen what the media have seen," said Steward at the conference hosted by law firm Brown Rudnick and barrister set Outer Temple Chambers. But, he warned, "headlines are quite different from prosecutions."
