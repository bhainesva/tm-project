Where do those who have it all, and then some, stow their most treasured belongings? For nearly a century, Magstadt, Germany-based Doettling — makers of luxury safes — have been crafting their pieces from materials that evoke a world of luxury and opulence beyond the reach of almost everyone. What comes from their factory is finished as finely as a Swiss watch. Photographs by Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg
