A Macquarie Group Ltd. investment fund agreed to buy Deutsche Bank AG’s container terminal in Port Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Deutsche Bank acquired the 454-acre Maher Terminals USA in 2007, the Frankfurt-based firm said Thursday in a statement that didn’t disclose terms. The deal is “not expected to have a material impact on Deutsche Bank’s financials,” according to the statement.
