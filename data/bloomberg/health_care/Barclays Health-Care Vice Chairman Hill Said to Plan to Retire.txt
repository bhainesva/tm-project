Barclays Plc’s vice chairman for health care, Michael Hill, plans to retire this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Hill, who was previously global co-head of health-care investment banking at the London-based bank, will remain in his post until the summer, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans are private. A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment.

Hill joined Barclays in 2011 from Citigroup Inc., where he was a managing director in its health care and consumer banking team, according to his LinkedIn page. Before Citigroup, Hill spent more than 11 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York, London and Frankfurt.

The Barclays health-care team played a role in some of the biggest deals in the industry in the past year. The firm advised Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on its $40.5 billion offer for Allergan Plc’s generics business and Shire Plc on its $32 billion takeover bid for Baxalta Inc. in January. Richard Landgarten is the head of global investment banking for Barclays’s health-care group.

Hill’s retirement will follow a number of high-profile appointments on the team. In September, Barclays hired Axel-Sven Malkomes from Societe Generale SA as vice chairman for health care investment banking in Frankfurt. In 2014, the bank hired Will Thompson from UBS Group AG to lead the group’s investment banking team in Europe, Middle East and Africa.
