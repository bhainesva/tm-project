Negotiations have stalled in billionaire Sumner Redstone’s effort to settle an ex-girlfriend’s lawsuit claiming he is mentally incompetent, her lawyer said.

After people familiar with the matter said last week that a preliminary agreement had been reached, the talks have hit “a snag,” Pierce O’Donnell, an attorney for Manuela Herzer, said Tuesday.

“It’s not about monetary issues, it’s about language in the settlement,” he said, adding that he remains hopeful an accord can be worked out.

The dispute has exposed infighting among those closest to Redstone, including his daughter Shari and longtime confidant Philippe Dauman, and could impact the ailing media mogul’s control over Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp.

The case has been scheduled to go to trial May 6 in Los Angeles probate court.

The case is In re Advance Health Care Directive of Sumner M. Redstone, BP168725, Los Angeles County Superior Court.
