Thailand’s tourism stocks, including operators of high-end hospitals that market to foreigners, have outperformed the broader market by attracting visitors from China, India and the Middle East. The Tourism & Leisure Index has gained about 130 percent in five years, five times the benchmark SET Index’s rise and contrasting with a decline among agribusiness stocks in a nation that’s one of the world’s biggest rice, rubber and processed seafood exporters. The gauge of health-care providers was an even bigger winner, reflecting the success of Bangkok Dusit Medical Services Pcl and Bumrungrad Hospital Pcl in helping Thailand build a medical-tourism industry worth about $5 billion a year.
