Britain’s stocks fell, after completing a third quarterly decline in four.

The FTSE 100 Index dropped 0.5 percent at the close of trading in London, trimming for a second day its weekly gain, as miners such as Glencore Plc retreated. Standard Chartered Plc slid the most since March 24.

The U.K. benchmark index began the second quarter with declines after losing 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year. That was still better than all key developed markets in Europe, thanks to gains in miners and a weakening pound. Still, after rebounding from a low in February, the advances stalled last month.

Among stocks that rose, Shire Plc climbed 3.1 percent after Citigroup Inc. raised European health-care companies to neutral from the equivalent of a sell.

The broader FTSE All-Share Index and Ireland’s ISEQ Index also fell, along with the regional Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
