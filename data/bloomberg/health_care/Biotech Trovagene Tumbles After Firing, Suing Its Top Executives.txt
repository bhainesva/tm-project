Trovagene Inc.’s shares plunged as much as 21 percent after the maker of cancer-DNA detection and monitoring tests said it fired and sued its chief executive officer and chief financial officer.

Thomas Adams, Trovagene’s chairman, will be interim CEO, succeeding Antonius Schuh, the San Diego-based company said Monday in a statement. Trovagene didn’t name a successor to terminated CFO Stephen Zaniboni.

The stock fell 14 percent to $4.42 at 9:50 a.m. in New York. The stock had declined 27 percent in the past year through Monday.

The company “alleges that Dr. Schuh and Mr. Zaniboni failed to present a lucrative corporate opportunity to Trovagene concerning promising new therapeutics in the field of precision medicine and instead took that opportunity for their own personal benefit,” according to the statement.

The complaint was filed in California Superior Court in San Diego, the company said. It couldn’t be verified in court records. Schuh and Zaniboni didn’t respond to calls seeking comment.

Trovagene said it’s seeking to force Schuh and Zaniboni to give their interests in the new therapeutic technology to the company. The biotech firm didn’t provide additional details about the technology in the statement.

Adams, the new CEO, had been chairman of Trovagene since 2009, according to the statement. He earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California at Riverside, and has previously been an executive at other health-care firms, Trovagene said.
