Al Jazeera Media Network fired about 500 employees, most of them at its Qatar headquarters, as the state-backed company refocuses on digital content.

The cable news network began restructuring a few months ago, Mostefa Souag, Al Jazeera’s acting director-general, said in an e-mailed statement on Sunday. “We are confident this is an important decision to improve our competitiveness,” he said.

Al Jazeera said in January that it was shutting down its U.S. television operation, which had struggled to build an audience. The company, which entered the American market after paying $500 million for Al Gore’s Current TV, produced in-depth reporting on topics such as health-care reform, drugs in baseball and gun violence in Chicago.

The TV network, which has offices in more than 70 cities, said it will continue expanding its international digital operations and will establish new platforms in the U.S.
