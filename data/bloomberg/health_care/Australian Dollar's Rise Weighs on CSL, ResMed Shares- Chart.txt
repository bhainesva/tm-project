The rally for the Australian dollar, now near a nine-month high, is weighing on health-care companies CSL Ltd. and ResMed Inc., which count the U.S. as their biggest market. However, both stocks may rebound in the months ahead, Morgans Financial Ltd. says, because the currency will retrace its gains as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Morgans expects the Aussie to fall to $0.705 by the end of the year.
