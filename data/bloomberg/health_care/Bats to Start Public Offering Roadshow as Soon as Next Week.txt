Bats Global Markets Inc., the exchange group making its second swipe at a public offering, will begin its roadshow as soon as next week, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The timing positions it to be one of the first U.S. IPOs of 2016 outside of the health-care industry, and the biggest company so far at a market value of about $2 billion, people familiar with the matter said in December. Stock market volatility and wary investors have kept the market for going public quiet so far in 2016. Only nine companies have listed on American exchanges for the slowest start to the year since the recession.

It’s not Bats’s first time at the IPO altar. The Lenexa, Kansas-based securities market flubbed its first attempt to go public on its own exchange four years ago because of an error in its trading software. The company is again planning to list its own shares under the ticker BATS, according to its prospectus.

Randy Williams, a spokesman for Bats, declined to comment on the roadshow.

Bats was formed more than 10 years ago by a consortium of financial institutions to rival the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market in technology, speed and pricing. It has grown to become the second largest U.S. stock exchange operator behind NYSE. Its owners include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., KCG Holdings Inc. and Citadel LLC.

The company filed with an offering size of $100 million, which is a placeholder used to calculate fees and will change. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. are leading the offering.
