Singaporeâ€™s government will raise expenditure in fiscal 2016 by S$5 billion ($3.7 billion), or 7.3 percent, and still expects a surplus equivalent to 0.8 percent of gross domestic product. The bulk of the budget goes to defense, education, health care and transport. The budget is aided by an increase in tax revenue to 14.4 percent of GDP and higher net investment returns contributions from state investment companies and institutions like Temasek Holdings Pte, GIC Pte and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
