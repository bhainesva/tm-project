Relief rally? Japan’s benchmark Topix index staged a comeback from a two-day decline on speculation the country’s central bank will boost stimulus after last week’s deadly earthquake. Behind the biggest rally for Tokyo shares in seven weeks were some companies which halted operations after the earthquake. Energy explorers such as Inpex Corp. and Japan Petroleum Exploration also recovered with crude. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday said he would consider speeding up a transfer of tax revenues to local governments and using surplus budget funds in response to the quake.
