Eurus Energy Holdings Corp. will build a 42-megawatt wind power station in Japanâ€™s northern prefecture of Akita.

The plant, which will start in April 2018, will use 13 3.2-megawatt wind turbines supplied by Siemens AG, the Tokyo-based wind developer said in a statement Monday.

The company has four operating wind power stations with a combined capacity of 107 megawatts in Akita, according to the statement.

Eurus completed a 20-megawatt wind power station in Victoria, Australia, it said in a separate statement Monday.
