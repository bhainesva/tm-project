Hitachi Zosen Corp. won an order for a waste-to-energy plant from KPN Green Energy Solution Co. in Thailandâ€™s Nong Khai province.

The 6-megawatt plant will be operated by Nongkhainayu Co., Hitachi Zosen said in a statement Wednesday. KPN is in charge of engineering, procurement and construction work for the station and ordered Hitachi Zosen to provide incinerators and waste-gas processing equipment.

Nongkhainayu has a contract with a local government office to operate a waste-processing business for 25 years, according to Osaka-based Hitachi Zosen, which also designs and builds industrial plants and water treatment systems.
