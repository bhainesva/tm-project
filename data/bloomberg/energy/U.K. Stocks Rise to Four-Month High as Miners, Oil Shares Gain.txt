U.K. stocks advanced to their highest level in more than four months as miners and energy companies rose with commodities.

Tullow Oil Plc added 5 percent, leading gains in energy-related stocks as crude rose. Anglo American Plc and Antofagasta Plc climbed at least 7.6 percent as base metals gained. Associated British Foods Plc increased 2 percent after reporting earnings that beat analyst estimates as improved results from its sugar business offset a decline in profit at its Primark discount retail chain.

The FTSE 100 Index added 0.8 percent to 6,405.35 at the close of trading in London. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also advanced 0.8 percent today, while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ gained 0.7 percent.
