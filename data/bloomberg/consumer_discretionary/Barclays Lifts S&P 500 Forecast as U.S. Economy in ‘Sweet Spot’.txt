Barclays Plc raised its year-end forecast for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to 1,450 from 1,420, saying the U.S. economic recovery is strong enough to survive surging oil prices.

Barry Knapp, the New York-based chief equity strategist for the third-biggest U.K. bank, lifted his per-share profit estimate for companies in the index this year to $93 from $91, citing better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and increasing confidence in the financial sector margins.

“We are more optimistic than we have been at this time in each of the last two years,” Knapp wrote in a report dated Feb. 25. “The economy is in a ‘sweet spot’ of accommodative monetary policy and faces an improving economic outlook that favors cyclical sectors.”

The S&P 500 has advanced 5.7 percent this year as corporate earnings beat Wall Street estimates for an eighth-straight quarter and the Federal Reserve maintained a pledge to make $600 billion in asset purchases through June to boost the U.S. economy. The benchmark measure for U.S. stocks slid 1.7 percent last week to 1,319.88 as anti-government uprisings in Libya pushed oil prices higher and prompted concern economic growth may falter.

Barclays raised its recommendation for industrial companies to “overweight” and health-care and financial stocks to “marketweight,” while lowering its rating of consumer discretionary companies to “marketweight.” Large-scale asset purchases are a tailwind for cyclical stocks, companies that are closely tied to economic growth, and a headwind for defensives, the London-based bank said.

“The market is currently struggling to quantify a new exogenous risk, the political instability in the Middle East and a related oil shock,” Knapp wrote. “However, given the experience of the last decade, our current thinking is that the shock will not be large enough to derail the recovery.”

The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 1,328.48 at 10:59 a.m. in New York. Crude oil futures for April delivery rose 7 cents to $97.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
