For U.S. executives, the road to riches doesn’t necessarily run through Wall Street. Among the country’s 200 highest-paid senior managers, those at consumer-discretionary companies were awarded an average $48.6 million. That’s more than 35 percent above the mean paycheck of their colleagues in the finance industry, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index, which ranks compensation using the most recent data as of a company’s fiscal year-end.
