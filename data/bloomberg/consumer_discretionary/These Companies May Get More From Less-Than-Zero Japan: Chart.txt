A dozen big companies from outside of Asia report revenue from Japan, positioning them to benefit from the country’s move to boost its economy with negative interest rates. They include six drugmakers, three tech companies and three consumer discretionary businesses with between 1.9 percent and 8.6 percent of their sales from Japan, according to their most recent earnings reports. Seven are from other less-than-zero economies: the euro zone, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden. The world’s biggest company, Apple Inc., gets 6.3 percent of its revenue from Japan.
