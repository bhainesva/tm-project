China’s stocks fluctuated. Lenders gained after profits at Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of China Ltd. beat estimates while consumer discretionary stocks dropped on concern recent gains were overdone.

The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China’s stock exchanges, was little changed at 2,997.91 as of 2:26 p.m. after changing direction more than 10 times.
