Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB, the country's largest retailer, fell to the lowest in more than a week in Mexico City after October sales trailed analysts' estimates.

Walmex, as the company is known, slipped 4.1 percent to 33.10 pesos as of 10:59 a.m. New York time. The shares have fallen 12 percent this year, compared with a decline of 32 percent in the Bolsa index.

October sales at stores open at least a year rose 2 percent from a year earlier, Walmex said in a statement yesterday after markets closed. Sales during comparable four-week periods fell 0.4 percent, the company said.

Declines in Mexican consumer confidence and spending affected the sales, Banco Santander SA wrote in a report today. The monthly sales increase was less than the 3 percent gain forecast by analysts Joaquin Ley and Roberto Liano.

``The data posted by Walmex for October is undoubtedly a negative, being weak and coming in below expectations,'' the analysts wrote. They reduced their rating to ``hold'' from ``buy'' yesterday.

Consumer confidence fell in October to the lowest level since Mexico's national statistics institute began tracking the measure in 2001. The index decreased to 82 from 88.6 in September, the institute said yesterday.

Walmex saw non-food sales decline as consumers spent less on discretionary items, Credit Suisse analysts led by Tufic Salem wrote. They had expected October sales to rise 2 percent to 2.5 percent. Fourth-quarter sales at stores open a year or more may rise 1 percent to 2 percent, Credit Suisse predicted, keeping their ``outperform'' rating on shares.
