Raymond James Financial Inc. advised investors to buy the stock, raising its recommendation to ``outperform'' from ``market perform.''

Deere & Co. (DE US) lost 10 percent, the most since August 2005, to $81.10. The world's largest maker of tractors and combines said profit in the fiscal third quarter will fall short of analysts' projections as U.S. construction slows and material prices jump. Second-quarter profit also trailed estimates.

Evergreen Solar Inc. (ESLR US) rose the most since Feb. 13, gaining 11 percent to $9.38. Jefferies & Co. analyst upgraded the maker of wafers used in solar-power panels to ``buy'' from ``hold,'' saying concerns about its ability to raise capital are reflected in the share price.

Freddie Mac (FRE US) increased the most since April 1, rising 9 percent to $27.21. The second-largest U.S. mortgage- finance company posted a loss that was narrower than analysts estimated and said it will raise $5.5 billion to help overcome rising credit costs.

Jack in the Box Inc. (JBX US) tumbled 10 percent, the most since September 2005, to $24.98. The owner and franchiser of its namesake hamburger restaurants and Qdoba Mexican Grill said 2008 same-store sales will trail its forecast. Second-quarter profit dropped as food costs increased and consumer spending slowed.

Javelin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (JAV US) rose the most since November 2005, climbing 14 percent to $3.26. The developer of pain medications said it may look for a strategic partner for one of its candidates, suggesting it might raise capital without diluting shareholders, according to Elemer Piros, senior biotechnology analyst at Rodman & Renshaw.

Macy's Inc. (M US) rose the most since April 25, climbing 4.5 percent to $25.13. The second-biggest U.S. department-store chain said first-quarter sales fell less than analysts estimated and it reiterated annual forecasts. Macy's vendors Coach Inc.

Staples Inc. (SPLS US) rose 5.7 percent, the most since April 1, to $23.71. The world's largest office-supplies retailer was upgraded to ``buy'' from ``hold'' at Jefferies & Co. Staples' sweetened bid for Corporate Express NV, the biggest distributor of office supplies, increases the odds of a combination that will boost earnings, Jefferies analysts led by Daniel Binder wrote in a report.
