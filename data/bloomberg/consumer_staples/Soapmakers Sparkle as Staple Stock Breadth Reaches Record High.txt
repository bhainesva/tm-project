Makers of food, beverages, tobacco and other consumer staples are in a better position to sustain U.S. stock-market gains than companies in other industries, according to Jonathan Krinsky, MKM Partners LLC’s chief market technician.

The chart below illustrates how Krinsky reached his conclusion, presented two days ago in a report. He compared two versions of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Consumer Staples Index: one that counts each company equally, and the other that assigns them different weights based on market capitalization.

The ratio of the equal-weighted index to its cap-weighted counterpart rose to a record last week and climbed 5.7 percent for the year through yesterday. The year-to-date gain contrasts with a 2.7 percent decline for a similar S&P 500 ratio, also shown in the chart, which peaked in April.

“Consumer staples stand out to us,” Krinsky wrote. The New York-based analyst cited 20 stocks worth buying in the industry group. Seven of them -- Calavo Growers Inc., John B. Sanfilippo & Son Inc., Medifast Inc., MGP Ingredients Inc., Omega Protein Corp., Prestige Brands Holdings Inc. and Orchids Paper Products Co. -- were small caps.

The relatively strong performance of the category’s smaller companies also got the attention of Ari Wald, Oppenheimer & Co.’s head of technical analysis. In a report yesterday, he wrote that the equal-weight/cap-weight comparison is a positive signal for consumer staples more broadly.

Wald, who is also based in New York, highlighted the ratio as one of three “under-the-radar trends for 2016.” The others were renewed weakness in utility stocks and a recovery among the shares of oil and gas refiners.
