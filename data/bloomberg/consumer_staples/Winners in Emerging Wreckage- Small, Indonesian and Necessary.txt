Oh, to have bet on Indonesia’s roads this week.

Jakarta-based PT Jasa Marga Persero, which operates the country’s highway system, is up 11 percent so far this year, outperforming all but four of the other 837 members of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. With a market value of less than $3 billion, it’s fairly typical of stocks that have managed to eke out gains amid the market wreckage since 2016 dawned wrought by worries about China’s economy.

More than a third of the Indonesian stocks in the index have gained this year, the best record among countries with at least 20 companies represented in the benchmark. On average, the Southeast Asia country’s shares fell less than 1 percent, compared with the emerging-market index’s 6.7 percent dive in the year’s first four trading days.

Of companies valued at less than $10 billion, 13 percent rose. Only a dozen of almost 200 companies with market caps greater than $25 billion are up; the 19 biggest all fell. One in four consumer-staples companies gained, the best of the index’s 10 industry groups.
