Venezuela’s government is raising the price of corn flour and rice by as much as 24 percent for the first time since March in a bid to avoid food shortages.

The government, which regulates prices of basic food goods, raised the cap on corn flour, which is used to make the breakfast staple arepa, by 24 percent to 3.37 bolivars ($0.78) per kilo from 2.72, according to a resolution published today in the Official Gazette. It also raised the cap on rice by 22 percent to 4.46 bolivars per kilo from 3.66.

The hike in food costs will likely push up consumer prices in Venezuela, which has the highest inflation rate of 78 economies tracked by Bloomberg, after the government managed to slow inflation for five consecutive months. That was achieved because prices were officially frozen during that period, said Boris Segura, Latin America economist at Nomura Securities International Inc.

“The price adjustments are below accumulated inflation so as not to add more wood to the fire,” said Segura in a telephone interview from New York. “The government needs to make periodic adjustments to avoid food shortages that also provoke inflation.”

Venezuela last raised food prices by as much as 35 percent in March on sugar, rice and chicken. Monthly inflation in April as measured by the Caracas price index was 5.2 percent.

Inflation in Venezuela will close the year at 27 percent, Segura said.
