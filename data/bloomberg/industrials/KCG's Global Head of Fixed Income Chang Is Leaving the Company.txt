Isaac Chang, one of KCG Holdings Inc.’s top traders, is leaving the firm, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News.

Sophie Sohn, a spokeswoman for KCG, confirmed the departure of Chang, the global head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading. Neither the memo nor Sohn said where he’s going. Chang didn’t return a phone call seeking a comment.

Chang joined Getco, one of KCG’s predecessor companies, in 2011 to focus on proprietary trading and market making. At KCG he reported to Ryan Primmer, KCG’s global head of quantitative and systematic trading. Before that, he worked for nearly 12 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he traded interest-rate products, and was an analyst at BlackRock Inc., according to his LinkedIn profile. Getco, an automated trading firm, combined with brokerage Knight Capital Group Inc. in 2012 to form KCG.

KCG has played a role in modernizing fixed-income trading, with Chang helping lead the way. When the company became a member of the committee advising the U.S. Treasury on debt management last year, Chang represented the company. The move to include KCG on the committee, called the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, was an acknowledgement of the prominence of high-speed traders like KCG in the Treasuries market.
