An ounce of gold buys the fewest ounces of silver since December after silver climbed on signs of stabilization in China, the worldâ€™s biggest consumer of commodities. More than 50 percent of global demand for silver comes from industry. The metal surged 5.7 percent last week, while gold declined. Holdings in exchange-traded funds are around the highest since 2014 and money managers are the most bullish since at least 2006.
