China, which posted 6.7 percent growth in the first quarter, is poised to overtake Brazil this year in terms of purchasing-power parity. China’s per-capita income will rise to $15,095, or $47 more than in Latin America’s largest economy, based on International Monetary Fund estimates for gross domestic product in current dollars. Average income in Brazil, struggling with the deepest recession in decades, was double China’s as recently as 2006, with industrialization rates and commodity prices driving the shift.
