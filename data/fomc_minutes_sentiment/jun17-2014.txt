-0.5	Labor market indicators generally showed further improvement. 
-0.5	Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was seen as being well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks. 
-0.5	In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. 
-0.5	In some advanced foreign economies, inflation moved up recently from earlier low readings. 
-0.5	    Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. 
-0.5	There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period.
-0.5	Consistent with some improvement in investor sentiment toward risky assets, foreign equity prices generally rose over the intermeeting period, and foreign sovereign and corporate bond spreads narrowed. 
-0.5	In particular, low implied volatility in equity, currency, and fixed-income markets as well as signs of increased risk-taking were viewed by some participants as an indication that market participants were not factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy. 
-0.5	Overall, participants generally expressed a preference for a simple and clear approach to normalization that would facilitate communication to the public and enhance the credibility of monetary policy. 
-1.0	Measures of uncertainty in other financial markets also declined; results from the Desk's primary dealer survey suggested this development might have reflected low realized volatilities, generally favorable economic news, less uncertainty for the path of monetary policy, and complacency on the part of market participants about potential risks.
-0.5	Permits for single-family homes, which are usually a better indicator of the underlying pace of residential construction, increased only a little on balance. 
-0.5	The staff continued to forecast that inflation would remain below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years. 
-0.5	The SOMA manager reported on the System open market operations during the period since the Committee met on April 29-30, 2014, outlined the testing of the Term Deposit Facility, described the results from the fixed-rate overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operational exercise, and provided some possible options for adjusting the list of counterparties eligible to participate in ON RRP operations. 
-0.5	The appropriate size of the spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates was discussed, with many participants judging that a relatively wide spread--perhaps near or above the current level of 20 basis points--would support trading in the federal funds market and provide adequate control over market interest rates. 
0.5	Real state and local government purchases appeared to edge up going into the second quarter. 
-0.5	The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. 
-0.5	Automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of light motor vehicle assemblies would step up in the coming months, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national manufacturing surveys, were consistent with moderate increases in factory output in the near term.
-0.5	Foreign real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter, especially in China and some other emerging market economies. 
-0.5	Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but the Committee anticipated that with stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity, inflation would, over time, return to the Committee's 2 percent objective. 
-0.5	The unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent in April and remained at that level in May. 
-0.5	The Committee's consideration of this topic was undertaken as part of prudent planning and did not imply that normalization would necessarily begin sometime soon. 
-0.5	The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index, continued to decline and ended the period near its historical lows. 
-0.5	Conditions in unsecured short-term dollar funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period. 
0.0	The Committee agreed to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate and to reiterate its forward guidance about how it would assess the appropriate timing of the first increase in the target rate and the anticipated behavior of the federal funds rate after it is raised. 
-0.5	Participants requested additional analysis from the staff on issues related to normalization and agreed that it would be helpful to continue to review these issues at upcoming meetings. 
-0.5	Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period had limited effects in financial markets. 
-0.5	The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m
0.0	Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, Loretta J. 
-0.5	Regardless of whether they preferred to introduce a change to the Committee's reinvestment policy before or after the initial tightening in short-term interest rates, a number of participants thought that it might be best to follow a graduated approach with respect to winding down reinvestments or to manage reinvestments in a manner that would smooth the decline in the balance sheet. 
-0.5	Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) declined a little in April following strong gains in February and March. 
-1.0	The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
0.0	Powell, and Daniel K. 
-0.5	On balance, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment: The expected path of the federal funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on longer-term Treasury securities moved down modestly, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed.
-0.5	In addition, small businesses reported improvements in credit availability. 
-0.5	The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
0.5	In addition, both bond and equity emerging market mutual funds saw net inflows over the period.
-0.5	A couple of participants suggested that adequate control of short-term rates might be accomplished with a very wide spread or even without an ON RRP facility. 
-0.5	It was observed that it would be useful for the Committee to develop and communicate its plans to the public later this year, well before the first steps in normalizing policy become appropriate. 
-0.5	Some participants commented that their contacts in small and medium-sized businesses reported an improved outlook for sales, and several heard businesses more generally discuss plans to increase capital expenditures. 
-0.5	The average pace of employment gains stepped up, and the unemployment rate declined markedly in April and held steady in May, although it was still elevated. 
0.0	However, a couple of participants anticipated that the decline in unemployment would be damped as part-time workers shift to full-time jobs and as nonparticipants rejoin the labor force, while a few others commented that they expected no lasting reversal of the decline in labor force participation.
-0.5	Inflation continued to be low, however, in the euro area, and the European Central Bank (ECB) announced additional stimulus measures.
-0.5	Both mortgage applications for home purchases and refinancing applications remained at very low levels.
-0.5	Benchmark sovereign bond yields declined modestly in most countries, but U.K. gilt yields rose. 
-0.5	Participants offered views on a range of issues related to policy communications. 
0.5	Increases in measures of labor compensation remained modest. 
-0.5	In discussing economic developments abroad, a couple of participants noted that recent monetary policy actions by the ECB and the Bank of Japan had improved the outlook for economic activity in those areas and could help return inflation to target. 
-0.5	In contrast, some others expected a faster pickup in inflation or saw upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations because they anticipated a more rapid decline in economic slack.
-0.5	Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks' balance sheets increased and issuance of leveraged loans remained strong. 
-0.5	Household spending appeared to be rising moderately and business fixed investment resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. 
-0.5	Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
0.0	Meeting participants continued their discussion of issues associated with the eventual normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy. 
-0.5	That improvement was evidenced by the decline in the unemployment rate as well as by changes in other indicators, such as solid gains in nonfarm payrolls, a low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, uptrends in quits and job openings, and more positive views of job availability by households. 
0.0	Most participants agreed that adjustments in the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) should play a central role during the normalization process. 
-0.5	Recent information about key factors that influence household spending mostly pointed to gains in PCE in the coming months. 
-0.5	In addition, the presentation outlined design features of a potential ON RRP facility and discussed options for the Committee's policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in agency MBS.
-1.0	Over the same 12-month period, consumer energy prices rose faster than total consumer prices, while consumer food prices climbed more slowly than overall prices; core PCE inflation--which excludes food and energy prices--was also around 1-1/2 percent. 
-0.5	Mortgage interest rates declined somewhat more than long-term Treasury yields over the intermeeting period, while option-adjusted spreads on production-coupon MBS narrowed. 
-0.5	By contrast, late in the period, market participants interpreted statements by Bank of England Governor Carney as signaling an earlier tightening of policy than had been anticipated, and near-term policy rate expectations moved higher in response. 
-0.5	A couple of participants noted that, to date, consumer spending had been supported importantly by gains in household net worth while income gains had been held back by only modest increases in wages. 
-0.5	Participants discussed the prospects for wage increases to pick up as slack in the labor market diminishes. 
-0.5	The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate in the medium term. 
-0.5	The pace of activity in the housing sector remained subdued. 
-0.5	Some participants suggested that the Committee's communications about its forward guidance should emphasize more strongly that its policy decisions would depend on its ongoing assessment across a range of indicators of economic activity, labor market conditions, inflation and inflation expectations, and financial market developments. 
0.5	Credit flows to nonfinancial corporations remained strong. 
-0.5	Much of the transitory increase in take-up occurred in response to a large seasonal reduction in outstanding Treasury debt and an associated drop in the rates on Treasury repurchase agreements during the first half of the second quarter that were reversed during the second half. 
0.5	The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discussion.
-0.5	These participants thought that an earlier change to the reinvestment policy would involve risks to the economic outlook if it was seen as suggesting that the Committee was likely to tighten policy more rapidly than currently anticipated or if it had unexpectedly large effects in MBS markets; moreover, an early change could add complexity to the Committee's communications at a time when it would be clearer to signal changes in policy through interest rates alone. 
-0.5	Several of those reports pointed to an absence of wage pressures, while some others indicated that tight labor markets or shortages of skilled workers were leading to upward pressure on wages in some areas or occupations and that an increasing proportion of small businesses were planning to raise wages. 
-0.5	Although participants marked down their expectations for average growth of real GDP over the first half of 2014, their projections beginning in the second half of 2014 changed little. 
-0.5	The Committee reiterated, however, that purchases were not on a preset course, and that its decisions about the pace of purchases would remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
-0.5	Most participants viewed this as a technical issue with no substantive macroeconomic consequences and no consequences for the eventual decision about the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate--a decision that will depend on the Committee's evolving assessments of actual and expected progress toward its objectives. 
-0.5	This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. 
-1.0	Real GDP also increased more slowly in Canada, in part because of severe winter weather, and the pace of economic activity remained weak in the euro area. 
0.0	Tarullo.
-0.5	With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to diminish slowly, inflation was projected to rise gradually toward the Committee's objective. 
-1.0	The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
-0.5	Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. 
-0.5	Primarily because of the combination of recent downward surprises in the unemployment rate and weaker-than-expected real GDP, the staff slightly lowered its assumed pace of potential output growth this year and next and slightly decreased its assumption for the natural rate of unemployment over this same period. 
-0.5	In that regard, circumstances that might entail either a slower or a more rapid removal of policy accommodation were cited. 
0.0	However, members continued to recognize that inflation persistently below its longer-run objective could pose risks to economic performance and agreed to monitor inflation developments closely for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its objective over the medium term.
0.0	:
0.0	However, several participants read the recent soft information on retail sales and health-care spending as raising some concern about the underlying strength in consumer spending. 
-0.5	Labor market conditions generally continued to improve over the intermeeting period. 
-0.5	The component of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE edged down in May, but light motor vehicle sales moved up briskly. 
-0.5	In addition, although there was significant dispersion among dealer responses, the median dealer expected the FOMC to end its reinvestment of principal payments on Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS sometime after the first increase in the federal funds rate target; in the April survey, the median dealer had expected reinvestments to end before liftoff.
-0.5	In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first half of this year as a whole was lower, on net, than in the projection for the April meeting. 
0.0	Monetary Policy Normalization
-0.5	Participants discussed design features that could address these concerns, including constraints on usage either in the aggregate or by counterparty and a relatively wide spread between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate that would help limit the facility's size. 
-0.5	Measures of longer-horizon inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities remained about steady.
-0.5	Favorable financial conditions appeared be supporting economic activity. 
-0.5	In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. 
-0.5	Voting against this action: None.
-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. 
-0.5	The recovery in the housing sector was reported to have remained slow in all but a few areas of the country. 
0.5	Labor market conditions generally improved further. 
-0.5	Among the factors anticipated to support the sustained economic expansion were accommodative monetary policy, diminished drag from fiscal restraint, further gains in household net worth, improving credit conditions for households and businesses, and rising employment and wages. 
0.0	Staff Review of the Economic Situation
-0.5	Both imports and exports recovered from weak readings in February, with imports of consumer goods, automotive products, and capital goods rising significantly and exports of capital goods and industrial supplies showing particular strength.
-0.5	Consumer price inflation picked up in recent months, while measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable.
-0.5	While inflation was still seen as running below the Committee's longer-run objective, longer-run inflation expectations remained stable and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its 2 percent objective over the forecast period. 
-0.5	    The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. 
-0.5	At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced.
-0.5	Some stressed that the details should depend on financial and economic conditions.
-0.5	The unemployment rate, though lower, remained elevated. 
-0.5	If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. 
-0.5	They agreed that the Committee should continue to carefully monitor financial conditions and to emphasize in its communications the dependence of its policy decisions on the evolution of the economic outlook; it was also pointed out that, where appropriate, supervisory measures should be applied to address excessive risk-taking and associated financial imbalances. 
-0.5	It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, July 29-30. 
-0.5	In their view, an important element in the economic outlook was a pickup in income, from higher wages as well as ongoing employment gains, that would be expected to support a sustained rise in consumer spending.
0.0	However, the medium-term projection for inflation was revised down slightly, reflecting a reassessment by the staff of the underlying trend in inflation. 
-0.5	In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, the meeting participants submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy.3 The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. 
0.0	Mester, Charles I. 
-0.5	Federal spending data for April and May pointed toward only a small decline in real federal government purchases in the second quarter, as the pace of decreases in defense expenditures seemed to ease. 
-0.5	The Committee again stated that it currently anticipated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. 
-0.5	Over the 12 months ending in May, both total and core CPI inflation were about 2 percent. 
-0.5	The staff's economic projections for the June meeting were somewhat different from the forecasts presented at the March meeting, when the FOMC last prepared a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). 
-0.5	For example, a number of participants noted their concern that a more gradual approach might be appropriate if forecasts of above-trend economic growth later this year were not realized. 
-0.5	Other forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions, were also generally consistent with modest increases in business equipment spending in the near term. 
-0.5	Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
-0.5	These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the SEP, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes.
-0.5	Total take-up in the ON RRP exercise rose in April and May before falling back in June. 
-0.5	Beginning in July, the Desk is directed to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $20 billion per month and to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $15 billion per month. 
-0.5	Initial claims for unemployment insurance decreased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period, and the rate of job openings stepped up in April; nevertheless, the rate of hiring was unchanged and remained at a modest level.
-0.5	In May, the Federal Reserve began an eight-week series of test auctions of seven-day term deposits. 
-0.5	In addition, several saw developments in Iraq and Ukraine as posing possible downside risks to global economic activity or potential upside risks to world oil prices.
-0.5	Several noted that a return to growth in real wages in line with productivity growth would provide welcome support for household spending.
-0.5	In addition, participants examined possibilities for changing the calculation of the effective federal funds rate in order to obtain a more robust measure of overnight bank funding rates and to apply lessons from international efforts to develop improved standards for benchmark interest rates.
0.0	Yellen, William C. 
-0.5	Members saw the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. 
-0.5	While issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities started the year a bit slow relative to 2013, it has picked up recently. 
-0.5	Several others, however, remained concerned that persistent low inflation in Europe and Japan could eventually erode inflation expectations more broadly. 
-0.5	In April, nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased a little after rising briskly in March. 
-0.5	Yields on short- and medium-term nominal Treasury securities increased slightly, on balance, over the intermeeting period. 
-1.0	Real disposable income continued to rise in April, and households' net worth likely increased as equity prices and home values advanced further; however, consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers moved down somewhat in May and early June.
0.5	In assessing labor market conditions, participants again offered a range of views on how far conditions in the labor market were from those associated with maximum employment. 
-0.5	The guidance continued to emphasize that the Committee's decisions about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. 
-0.5	Even so, several participants pointed out that both long- and short-term unemployment and measures that include marginally attached workers had declined. 
-0.5	    "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months. 
-0.5	Over the year ending in May, average hourly earnings for all employees increased around 2 percent.
-0.5	Alternatively, some other participants expressed concern that economic growth over the medium run might be faster than currently expected or that the rate of growth of potential output might be lower than currently expected, calling for a more rapid move to begin raising the federal funds rate in order to avoid significantly overshooting the Committee's unemployment and inflation objectives.
-0.5	In contrast, yields at the long end of the curve edged lower, continuing a downward trend evident over much of this year. 
-0.5	Despite attractive mortgage rates, housing demand was seen as being damped by such factors as restrictive credit conditions, particularly for households with low credit scores; high down payments; or low demand among younger homebuyers, due in part to the burden of student loan debt. 
-0.5	The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. 
0.0	However, participants also discussed whether some recent trends in financial markets might suggest that investors were not appropriately taking account of risks in their investment decisions. 
-0.5	Both the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the rate of long-duration unemployment edged down in recent months, although both measures were still high. 
-0.5	Many judged that slack remained elevated, and a number of them thought it was greater than measured by the official unemployment rate, citing, in particular, the still-high level of workers employed part time for economic reasons or the depressed labor force participation rate. 
-0.5	In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the deputy manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets. 
-0.5	The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability." 
-0.5	    To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. 
-0.5	The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run." 
-0.5	In May, the consumer price index (CPI) increased at a faster pace than in the preceding few months; both food and energy prices rose more briskly, and core CPI inflation also stepped up. 
-0.5	Some committee members had been asked by members of the public whether, if tapering in the pace of purchases continues as expected, the final reduction would come in a single $15 billion per month reduction or in a  $10 billion reduction followed by a $5 billion reduction. 
-0.5	While generally agreeing that an ON RRP facility could play an important role in the policy normalization process, participants discussed several potential unintended consequences of using such a facility and design features that could help to mitigate these consequences. 
0.5	Most measures of labor market conditions improved in recent months. 
-0.5	U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was about 1-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in April, below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent. 
0.0	However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
-0.5	Household spending appeared to have risen moderately, on balance, in recent months, with sales of motor vehicles, in particular, rising strongly. 
-0.5	Some participants expressed concern about the persistence of below-trend inflation, and a couple of them suggested that the Committee may need to allow the unemployment rate to move below its longer-run normal level for a time in order keep inflation expectations anchored and return inflation to its 2 percent target, though one participant emphasized the risks of doing so. 
-0.5	Many participants expressed concern about the still-soft indicators of residential construction, and they discussed a range of factors that might be contributing to either a temporary delay in the housing recovery or a persistently lower level of homebuilding than previously anticipated. 
-0.5	The manager also noted the effects of recent foreign central bank policy actions on the yields on the international portion of the SOMA portfolio and discussed ongoing staff work on improving data collections regarding bank funding markets. 
-0.5	Participants also discussed the appropriate time for making a change to the Committee's policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. 
0.5	As a result, the rate of industrial capacity utilization rose in recent months. 
-0.5	It was generally agreed that an ON RRP facility with an interest rate set below the IOER rate could play a useful supporting role by helping to firm the floor under money market interest rates. 
-0.5	The foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed, on balance, over the period, as the dollar appreciated against the euro but declined against the Canadian dollar and many emerging market currencies. 
-0.5	Despite generally lackluster results for first-quarter earnings, corporate guidance for profits in coming quarters led to upward revisions in analysts' forecasts of year-ahead earnings per share for S&P 500 firms. 
-0.5	The staff's forecast for inflation in the near term was revised up a little as recent data showed somewhat faster increases in consumer prices than anticipated. 
-0.5	Over the next two and a half years, they continued to expect economic activity to expand at a rate sufficient to lead to a further decline in the unemployment rate to levels close to their current assessments of its longer-run normal value. 
0.5	The number of participants and the total amount awarded increased over the course of the first five operations.
-0.5	Those participants thought that such an approach would avoid weakening the credibility of the Committee's communications regarding normalization, would act to modestly reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, or would help prepare the public for the eventual rise in short-term interest rates. 
-0.5	Economic growth continued to be strong in the United Kingdom, and economic activity jumped in Japan as household spending surged in advance of April's consumption tax hike. 
-0.5	In light of these considerations, participants generally agreed that if incoming information continued to support its expectation of improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation toward its longer-run objective, it would be appropriate to complete asset purchases with a $15 billion reduction in the pace of purchases in order to avoid having the small, remaining level of purchases receive undue focus among investors. 
0.0	However, a few participants thought that, given the degree of uncertainty about the effects of the Committee's tools on market rates, it might be preferable to focus on an administered rate in communicating the stance of policy during the normalization period. 
0.0	Most participants indicated that they expected to learn more about the effects of the Committee's various policy tools as normalization proceeds, and many favored maintaining flexibility about the evolution of the normalization process as well as the Committee's longer-run operating framework. 
-0.5	While the current asset purchase program is not on a preset course, participants generally agreed that if the economy evolved as they anticipated, the program would likely be completed later this year. 
-0.5	Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products were estimated to have increased slowly in the first quarter as a whole. 
-0.5	Results from the Desk's June Survey of Primary Dealers indicated no change in the dealers' consensus expectation about the most likely timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate target but showed a lower median longer-run level of the federal funds rate relative to the April survey. 
-1.0	The expected path of ECB policy rates implied by market quotes for short-term interest rates fell over the intermeeting period, as investors anticipated the easing of policy announced by the ECB at its June meeting. 
0.5	Conditions in consumer credit markets were solid in recent months. 
-0.5	The unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated. 
-0.5	Broad stock price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, apparently boosted by a more optimistic assessment of near-term economic prospects and likely supported by continued low interest rates. 
-0.5	In addition, a number of participants noted that a relatively large ON RRP facility had the potential to expand the Federal Reserve's role in financial intermediation and reshape the financial industry in ways that were difficult to anticipate. 
-0.5	Committee Policy Action
-0.5	Dudley, Lael Brainard, Stanley Fischer, Richard W. 
0.0	Voting for this action: Janet L. 
-0.5	Bank and insurance company originations of commercial mortgages expanded in the first quarter.
-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. 
-0.5	During their consideration of issues related to monetary policy over the medium term, participants generally supported the Committee's current guidance about the likely path of its asset purchases and about its approach to determining the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and the path of the policy rate thereafter. 
0.0	However, the staff still anticipated that real GDP growth would rebound briskly in the second quarter, consistent with recent indicators for consumer spending and business investment, along with the expectation that exports and inventory investment would return to more normal levels and that economic activity that had been restrained by the severe winter weather would bounce back. 
-0.5	Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint was diminishing. 
-0.5	The U.S. international trade deficit widened in March and in April. 
-0.5	Others noted supply constraints, pointing to shortages of lots, low inventories of desirable homes for sale, an overhang of homes associated with foreclosures or seriously delinquent mortgages, or rising construction costs. 
-0.5	One participant noted that District businesses were investing largely to meet replacement needs, while another suggested that the backlog of such needs would likely provide some impetus to business investment.
-0.5	Industrial production increased, on balance, in April and May, as manufacturing output and production in the mining sector expanded and more than offset a further decline in the output of utilities from the elevated levels recorded during the unusually cold winter months. 
-0.5	At the same time, it was noted that monetary policy needed to continue to promote the favorable financial conditions required to support the economic expansion.
-0.5	A few participants commented that the Committee should also be prepared to use its other policy tools, including term deposits and term reverse repurchase agreements, if necessary. 
0.5	Credit card loan balances increased. 
0.0	However, the labor force participation rate also declined in April and then held steady in May, while the employment-to-population ratio remained flat. 
-0.5	The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by diminishing drag on spending from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth.
