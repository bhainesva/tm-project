-0.5	Several others, however, noted that weak productivity growth and low price inflation might be contributing to modest wage increases. 
0.0	.
-0.5	Members noted that recent global and financial market developments might restrain economic activity somewhat as a result of the higher level of the dollar and possible effects of slower economic growth in China and in a number of emerging market and commodity-producing economies. 
-0.5	The exchange value of the U.S. dollar rose notably over the period against the currencies of most major U.S. trading partners. 
-0.5	Although net exports remained soft, household spending and business fixed investment were increasing moderately, and the housing sector recovered further. 
-0.5	Such considerations also argued for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate gradually after policy normalization was under way. 
-0.5	Broad U.S. equity price indexes were highly correlated with foreign equity indexes over the intermeeting period and posted net declines. 
-0.5	State and local government purchases seemed to be increasing, on balance, as the payrolls of these governments expanded at a faster pace in July and August than in the second quarter, while their nominal construction expenditures edged down in July after a large gain in the second quarter.
-0.5	The rate of private-sector job openings increased in July and was at a high level, while the rates of hiring and quits were little changed.
-0.5	Inflation rates continued to be quite low in the advanced foreign economies, and market-based measures of inflation compensation had recently moved down in the euro area and Japan. 
-0.5	Many expected those conditions to be met later this year, although several members were concerned about downside risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation.
-0.5	Over the intermeeting period, the concerns about global economic growth and turbulence in financial markets led to greater uncertainty among market participants about the likely timing of the start of the normalization of the stance of U.S. monetary policy. 
-0.5	Sovereign yields in the advanced foreign economies ended the period roughly unchanged. 
-0.5	Members expected inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated, but they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
-0.5	Members anticipated that the declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period were likely to exert some additional downward pressure on inflation in the near term. 
-0.5	Real spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining increased sharply in the second quarter, and nominal business expenditures for such structures rose further in July. 
-0.5	In his view, further delay in removing monetary policy accommodation would represent a risky departure from past patterns of FOMC behavior in response to such economic conditions.
-0.5	In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 through 2018 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy. 
-0.5	It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, October 27-28, 2015. 
0.0	A few mentioned that a pickup in wage increases could bolster their confidence that resource utilization had tightened sufficiently to help move inflation toward the Committee's objective, but they did not view an acceleration in wages as a necessary condition for gaining such confidence.
-0.5	The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m
-0.5	The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
0.0	As a result, the
-0.5	Participants referred to the Committee's statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which indicates that the timing of the cessation or phasing out of reinvestments will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve. 
-0.5	During their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants indicated that they did not see the changes in asset prices during the intermeeting period as bearing significantly on their policy choice except insofar as they affected the outlook for achieving the Committee's macroeconomic objectives and the risks associated with that outlook. 
-0.5	In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in July indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace. 
-1.0	Core PCE prices, which exclude food and energy prices, increased 1-1/4 percent over the same period, with the increase damped in part by declines in the prices of non-energy imports. 
-0.5	Corporate bond and institutional leveraged loan issuance remained solid through July but moderated in August. 
-0.5	    "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. 
-0.5	In contrast, inflation in the emerging market economies had risen in recent months as a result of higher food prices and widespread currency depreciation.
-0.5	But some others believed that labor market slack in addition to that measured by the unemployment rate remained and that further progress was possible before labor market conditions were fully consistent with the Committee's objective of maximum employment. 
-0.5	Survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable, while market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower.
-0.5	Headline inflation continued to be held down by the effects of declines in energy and commodity prices, and the year-over-year increase in core PCE inflation remained below the Committee's objective. 
0.5	The available reports from District contacts in the retail and auto industries confirmed the recent solid gains in consumer spending.

-0.5	In the United States, equity prices fell, on balance, amid significant volatility, and risk spreads for businesses widened. 
-0.5	Most participants continued to anticipate that, based on their assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, the conditions for policy firming had been met or would likely be met by the end of the year. 
-0.5	With energy prices and non-oil import prices expected to begin to increase steadily next year, the staff projected that inflation would rise gradually over the next several years but would still be slightly below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent at the end of 2018. 
0.0	Staff Economic Outlook
-0.5	The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
-0.5	Labor market conditions continued to improve, but labor compensation gains were modest. 
-0.5	The incoming information on wages and labor compensation, including an especially low reading on the employment cost index for the second quarter, showed no broad-based acceleration. 
0.5	Sales of new and existing homes both increased in July.
-0.5	Data on overnight index swap rates indicated that investors marked down the expected path of the federal funds rate, on balance, over the intermeeting period.
-0.5	The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring developments abroad. 
-0.5	The deputy manager also discussed recent test operations of the Term Deposit Facility and updated the Committee on plans for tests of term reverse repurchase agreement operations at the end of the third quarter.
-0.5	Available indicators of drilling activity, such as counts of rigs in operation, suggested spending would decline less rapidly in the third quarter.
-0.5	Still, almost all participants anticipated that inflation would continue to run below 2 percent in the near term, particularly in light of the further decline in oil prices and further appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period. 
0.5	He viewed current disinflationary forces as likely to be transitory, and was reasonably confident that inflation would move toward 2 percent. 
-0.5	Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities fell to near their historical lows.
-0.5	Participants continued to judge that a significant portion of the shortfall was the result of the transitory effects of declines in prices of oil and non-energy commodities. 
-0.5	Moreover, the outlook for the energy sector appeared to be worsening. 
-0.5	The information reviewed for the September 16-17 meeting suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was expanding at a moderate pace in the third quarter. 
0.0	Tarullo, and John C. 
-0.5	To some, the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from current levels of labor utilization. 
0.0	Lockhart, Jerome H. 
0.5	This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. 
-0.5	In particular, the appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 was still a substantial drag on net exports, and the further rise in the dollar over the intermeeting period could augment the restraint on U.S. net exports. 
-0.5	The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm in its postmeeting statement that the Committee's decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. 
-0.5	The dollar also strongly appreciated against the currencies of most emerging market economies, as most Asian currencies weakened against the dollar following a depreciation of the Chinese renminbi, and as the currencies of commodity exporters fell along with declining commodity prices. 
-0.5	Regarding the most likely meeting date for the first rate increase, survey respondents were about evenly split between September and December. 
-0.5	System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy
-0.5	The briefing presented analysis that was based on an assumption that the cessation of reinvestments, once implemented, would be permanent. 
-0.5	The weakness in commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar also continued to weigh on activity in the energy and agricultural sectors. 
-0.5	This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
-0.5	The staff left its forecast for real GDP growth over the second half of the year little changed but lowered its projection for economic growth over the next several years. 
-0.5	There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period.
-0.5	Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. 
-0.5	A few participants pointed out that since January when the steep drop in energy prices ended, core PCE prices had risen at an annual rate of 1.7 percent, closer to the Committee's objective, despite the continued decline in prices of non-energy imports. 
-0.5	Participants also discussed various measures of expectations for inflation over the longer run. 
-0.5	The information on business spending from District contacts was mixed. 
-0.5	The deputy manager followed with a briefing on money market developments and System open market operations conducted by the Open Market Desk during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on July 28-29. 
-0.5	Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, edged up over the 12 months ending in July, restrained importantly by declines in energy prices. 
-0.5	The staff also further trimmed its assumptions for the rates of increase in productivity and potential output over the medium term. 
0.5	Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to be rising at a moderate pace in the third quarter. 
-1.0	They pointed out that, even recognizing the downward trend in labor force participation, the level of the participation rate, particularly for prime-age adults, remained depressed; similarly, the number of workers on part-time schedules for economic reasons was still elevated. 
-0.5	At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
0.0	However, it was noted that the decline seemed to be related to the further drop in oil prices or may importantly reflect shifts in risk and liquidity premiums, and thus may not signal additional broad and persistent downward price pressures.
0.0	However, several members saw a risk that the additional downward pressure on inflation from lower oil prices and a higher foreign exchange value of the dollar could persist and, as a result, delay or diminish the expected upturn in inflation. 
-0.5	Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
-0.5	Bank holdings of closed-end residential loans increased modestly, and the Mortgage Bankers Association's index of mortgage credit availability edged up further. 
-0.5	In addition, concerns associated with developments in China and other emerging market economies had contributed to a further appreciation of the dollar and declines in prices of oil and other commodities, which were likely to hold down U.S. consumer price inflation in the near term. 
-0.5	Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally accommodative, and the performance of outstanding consumer loans was largely stable. 
-0.5	A few participants expressed some concern about the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation. 
-0.5	The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. 
-1.0	Delinquency rates on credit card loans and auto loans stayed low through the second quarter, while delinquency rates on student loans remained elevated.
-0.5	Other factors important to the Committee's assessment of the inflation outlook were the expectation that the influences of lower energy and commodity prices on headline inflation would abate, as had occurred in previous episodes, and that inflation expectations would remain stable. 
0.0	Staff Review of the Economic Situation
0.0	However, spreads on investment-grade CMBS widened noticeably in August, reportedly a result of heavy issuance as well as the increased volatility in broader financial markets.
0.5	In manufacturing, the auto industry remained a bright spot, but the appreciation of the dollar was still restraining production of goods for export. 
-0.5	Household spending was supported by moderate growth in real disposable income in July and a wealth-to-income ratio that remained high even after recent declines in equity values. 
-0.5	Many participants judged that the effects of these developments on domestic economic activity were likely to be small, but they acknowledged the risk that they might restrain U.S. economic growth somewhat. 
-0.5	Growth in real GDP over the first half of the year was stronger than participants expected when they prepared their June forecasts, and the unemployment rate declined somewhat more than anticipated. 
-0.5	    "Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. 
-0.5	By notation vote completed on August 18, 2015, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on July 28-29, 2015. 
-0.5	Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
-0.5	A staff briefing provided background on the macroeconomic effects of alternative approaches to ceasing reinvestments of principal on securities held in the SOMA after the Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy by increasing the target range for the federal funds rate. 
-0.5	The Committee made no decisions regarding its strategy for ceasing or phasing out reinvestments at this meeting.
-0.5	The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run."
0.5	Industrial production increased, on balance, during July and August. 
-0.5	Spreads on 10-year triple-B-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened slightly over the intermeeting period.
-0.5	Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate. 
-0.5	In contrast, falling commodity prices and concerns about the pace of global growth contributed to capital outflows and generally wider spreads on dollar-denominated debt in emerging Asia and Latin America.
0.0	Participants weighed a number of risks associated with the timing of policy firming. 
-0.5	Conditions in the market for residential mortgages continued to improve slowly, with interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declining slightly. 
0.5	In the ensuing discussion, participants considered the advantages and disadvantages of alternative approaches to reinvestment. 
-1.0	Based on federal funds futures, the probability of a first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the September meeting fell slightly; the probabilities attached to subsequent meetings through January 2016 were generally little changed and rose for meetings later that year. 
-0.5	Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses tightened modestly over the summer. 
-0.5	It was noted that the expected path of the federal funds rate, rather than the exact timing of the initial increase, was most important in influencing financial conditions and thus the outlook for the economy and inflation. 
-0.5	Nonetheless, the Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. 
-0.5	The staff viewed the uncertainty around its September projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. 
-0.5	They continued to anticipate that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the pace of expansion of real activity would remain somewhat above its longer-run rate over the next two years and lead to further improvement in labor market conditions. 
-0.5	Housing activity was improving, with sales and new construction trending higher. 
0.0	Lacker.
-0.5	Committee Policy Action
-0.5	The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. 
-0.5	Participants discussed the potential implications of recent economic and financial developments abroad for U.S. economic activity and inflation. 
0.0	However, if substantial adverse shocks occurred, continuing reinvestment until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way could help avoid situations that would warrant a larger reduction in the federal funds rate than perhaps could be accomplished given the constraint posed by the effective lower bound to nominal interest rates.
-0.5	Some participants expressed a view that, in contrast to the assumption in the staff analysis, the Committee could choose to resume reinvestments if macroeconomic conditions warranted. 
-0.5	Participants anticipated that recent global developments would likely put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term; compared with their previous forecasts, more now saw the risks to inflation as tilted to the downside. 
-0.5	Credit card balances expanded amid gradually easing lending standards, and student and auto loans continued to be broadly available, even to borrowers with subprime credit scores. 
-0.5	Many of them saw the likely effects of recent developments on the path of economic activity and inflation as small or transitory. 
0.5	Members agreed that labor market conditions had improved considerably since earlier in the year, with ongoing solid gains in payroll employment and the unemployment rate falling to a level quite close to their estimates of its longer-run normal rate. 
0.0	Evans, Stanley Fischer, Dennis P. 
-0.5	After assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, all but one member concluded that, although the U.S. economy had strengthened and labor underutilization had diminished, economic conditions did not warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. 
-0.5	Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing moderately, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. 
-0.5	Several participants emphasized that continuing reinvestments for some time after the initial policy firming could help manage potential risks, particularly by reducing the probability that the federal funds rate might return to the effective lower bound. 
-0.5	Crude oil prices declined further over the intermeeting period and were expected to result in lower consumer energy prices, and the effects of recent dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices were anticipated to push down non-oil import prices. 
-1.0	Contacts in a number of Districts were upbeat about prospects for the sector, citing strengthening sales, rising home prices, an upturn in household formations, and reports that buyers had accelerated purchases in anticipation of the possibility that mortgage rates might move higher in the near term. 
-0.5	Multifamily construction was particularly strong in a couple of Districts, but in another a shortage of lots was constraining builders' ability to meet strong demand for new single-family homes.
-0.5	Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. 
-0.5	In the multifamily sector, starts fell back after having been temporarily elevated in June. 
-0.5	One member, however, preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, indicating that the current low level of real interest rates was not appropriate in the context of current economic conditions.
0.0	However, market-based measures of inflation compensation fell to near their historical lows, reportedly in response to the recent appreciation of the dollar, the decline in oil prices, and readings on realized inflation that were slightly below market expectations.
-0.5	A material slowdown in economic growth in China and potential adverse spillovers to other economies were likely to depress U.S. net exports to some extent. 
-0.5	The U.S. international trade deficit widened in June before narrowing substantially in July. 
-0.5	Starts of new single-family homes rose further early in the third quarter and were slightly above the pace of permit issuance. 
0.0	On net, the level of GDP was anticipated to rise above its potential next year, and that gap was projected to widen gradually over the medium term. 
-0.5	Stock market indexes in most advanced and emerging market economies ended the period sharply lower. 
-0.5	Financing for commercial real estate (CRE) remained broadly available, with CRE loans on banks' books expanding and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) staying robust. 
-0.5	Although concerns about global economic growth likely contributed to the declines in domestic equity prices, investors may also have reassessed valuations and risk in equity markets. 
0.0	Participants agreed that labor market conditions had improved considerably since earlier in the year. 
0.0	However, recent indicators for some other countries, most notably China, were subdued. 
-0.5	Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate demand and with the further adjustments to the staff's supply-side assumptions, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.
-0.5	Indicators for the third quarter pointed to a slight pickup in the pace of foreign growth, particularly as recent data for Canada suggested that some of the first-half weakness there was dissipating. 
0.0	They agreed that developments over the intermeeting period had not materially altered the Committee's economic outlook. 
-0.5	With the labor force participation rate unchanged over this period, the employment-to-population ratio edged up. 
-0.5	Some participants commented that the recent decline in equity prices needed to be viewed in the context of overall valuation levels, which they saw as relatively high, and a couple noted that volatility had begun to subside.
-0.5	Inflation was anticipated to move up to 2 percent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee's objective and slack in labor and product markets projected to have waned.
0.5	The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment. 
-0.5	The risks to the forecast for real GDP and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks. 
-0.5	At the same time, it was also highlighted that a larger balance sheet could entail costs, and that the Principles and Plans indicate that, in the longer run, the SOMA portfolio should be no larger than necessary to conduct monetary policy efficiently and effectively. 
0.0	Powell, Daniel K. 
0.5	The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment, and labor market indicators showed that underutilization of labor resources had diminished since early in the year.
-0.5	A number of participants reported that some of their business contacts were experiencing labor shortages in various occupations and geographic areas resulting in upward pressure on wages, with a few indicating that the pickup in wages had become more widespread.
-0.5	The briefing suggested that if economic conditions evolved in line with a modal outlook, differences in macroeconomic outcomes would be minor across approaches that ceased reinvestments soon after initial policy firming or continued reinvestments until certain levels of the federal funds rate, such as 1 percent or 2 percent, were reached. 
-0.5	In assessing whether economic conditions had improved sufficiently to initiate a firming in the stance of policy, many members said that the improvement in labor market conditions met or would soon meet one of the Committee's criteria for beginning policy normalization. 
-1.0	Domestic equity indexes were quite volatile in late August and early September, and one-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index reached levels last seen in 2011. 
-0.5	In contrast, imports declined in July, reversing a June increase, as imports of consumer goods fell back.
0.5	    When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. 
-0.5	While the dollar depreciated against the euro and the yen, it appreciated against the Canadian dollar. 
-0.5	Over the 12 months ending in August, average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2-1/4 percent.
-0.5	This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
-0.5	In their view, although the time for policy normalization might be near, it would be appropriate to wait for information, including evidence of further improvement in the labor market, confirming that the outlook for economic growth had not deteriorated significantly and that inflation was still on a path to return to 2 percent over the medium term. 
0.0	Yellen, William C. 
-0.5	Participants noted that ongoing gains in employment and real income were providing support for the rise in spending, and this support was expected to continue going forward. 
-0.5	Measures of expected longer-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable. 
-0.5	Activity in the housing sector remained on a gradual upward trend. 
-0.5	Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. 
0.0	Staff Review of the Financial Situation
-0.5	Despite the decline in global equity markets and the downward shift in the expected path of the federal funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury securities moved up modestly, with some market participants citing purported sales of Treasury securities by foreign government authorities to finance foreign exchange market intervention as a factor that likely put upward pressure on Treasury yields. 
-0.5	In addition, a prompt decision to firm policy could provide a signal of confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy that might spur rather than restrain economic activity. 
-0.5	By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. 
-0.5	Lacker dissented because he believed that maintaining exceptionally low real interest rates was not appropriate for an economy with persistently strong consumption growth and tightening labor markets. 
0.0	Williams.
0.0	Voting against this action: Jeffrey M. 
-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. 
-0.5	Nevertheless, yields on short- and longer-term nominal Treasury securities were modestly higher than when the Committee met in July.
-0.5	Total real government purchases appeared to be declining slightly in the third quarter. 
-0.5	But participants still expected that, as the labor market continued to improve and the transitory effects of declines in energy and non-oil import prices dissipated, inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term.
-0.5	For example, a significant delay risked an undesired buildup of inflationary pressures or economic and financial imbalances that would be costly to unwind and that eventually could have adverse consequences for economic growth. 
-0.5	Optimism remained relatively high according to some District contacts, although a few regional activity surveys noted some caution related to uncertainty about recent economic developments abroad. 
-0.5	Some other participants, however, expressed concerns about delaying the start of normalizing the target range for the federal funds rate much longer. 
-0.5	These projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes.
-0.5	These participants preferred to begin policy firming soon, with most of them expecting that beginning the process before long would allow the target range for the federal funds rate to be increased gradually.
-0.5	Members anticipated that economic activity was likely to continue to expand at a pace sufficient to lead to a further reduction in underutilization of labor resources. 
-0.5	Federal government purchases likely decreased, as defense spending moved down further through August. 
-0.5	Changes in peripheral euro-area sovereign yield spreads were mixed, with Greek sovereign spreads narrowing significantly over the period as Greece and the euro area finalized Greece's third bailout package. 
-0.5	Some participants were concerned that the downside risks to inflation could be realized if the target range for the federal funds rate was increased before it was clear that economic growth would remain at an above-trend pace and downward pressures on inflation had abated. 
-0.5	Nevertheless, in part because of the risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation, the Committee decided that it was prudent to wait for additional information confirming that the economic outlook had not deteriorated and bolstering members' confidence that inflation would gradually move up toward 2 percent over the medium term. 
0.5	Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in July and August. 
0.5	Consumer spending was rising at a solid rate after a modest increase in the first quarter. 
-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. 
-0.5	Manufacturing production fell in August primarily because of a large drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts that reversed a substantial portion of its jump in July. 
-0.5	Solid gains in employment and favorable mortgage rates were anticipated to continue to underpin the recovery in housing. 
-0.5	Survey-based measures of longer‑term inflation expectations had remained stable; market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower. 
-0.5	    The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. 
-0.5	With the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions, most participants thought that the underutilization of labor resources had been substantially reduced, and a few of them expressed the view that underutilization had been eliminated. 
-0.5	Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in July, and orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to modest gains in shipments in the coming months, consistent with recent readings from surveys of business conditions. 
0.0	The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons remained elevated. 
-0.5	In contrast, real business spending for drilling and mining structures fell steeply in the second quarter. 
-0.5	    To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. 
0.0	However, some participants judged that the downside risks to the outlook for economic growth and inflation had increased. 
0.0	Most members agreed that their confidence that inflation would move to the Committee's inflation objective would increase if, as expected, economic activity continued to expand at a moderate rate and labor market conditions improved further. 
-0.5	Recent readings on headline consumer price inflation reflected only small increases in core inflation and renewed weakness in consumer energy prices. 
-0.5	Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term. 
-0.5	With energy and commodity prices expected to stabilize, members' projections of inflation incorporated a step-up in headline inflation next year. 
-0.5	Measures of labor compensation rose faster than consumer prices over the past year, but the modest increases in compensation were similar to those seen in recent years. 
0.5	The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
-0.5	Participants made only small adjustments to their projections for economic activity over the medium term. 
-0.5	Nevertheless, they still viewed the risks to U.S. economic activity as nearly balanced, and they continued to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would most likely continue to expand at a moderate pace.
-0.5	Contacts were generally optimistic about the outlook, although retail sales appeared to be softening in a few areas where economic activity was adversely affected by declines in the energy sector and the increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
-0.5	Consumer price inflation remained below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent and was restrained by further declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices. 
-0.5	Payroll employment had been increasing steadily. 
0.5	Mining output moved up, on net, in July and August after a steep decline in the second quarter.
-0.5	The unemployment rate stayed at 5.3 percent in July but fell to 5.1 percent in August. 
-0.5	In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity was expanding moderately. 
-0.5	Although U.S. economic data releases generally met market expectations, domestic financial conditions tightened modestly as concerns about prospects for global economic growth, centered on China, prompted an increase in financial market volatility and a deterioration in risk sentiment during the intermeeting period. 
-0.5	They also worried that such a premature tightening might erode the credibility of the Committee's inflation objective if inflation stayed at a rate below 2 percent for a prolonged period. 
-0.5	The growth of commercial and industrial loans on banks' books slowed in July and August; the deceleration was concentrated in banks with greater exposures to oil and gas firms. 
-0.5	The staff projected that consumer price inflation would move down over the near term by more than in the previous projection. 
-0.5	It was noted that monetary policy was better positioned to respond effectively to unanticipated upside inflation surprises than to persistent below-objective inflation, particularly when the federal funds rate was still near its effective lower bound. 
-0.5	In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. 
-0.5	But some indicated that their confidence that inflation would gradually return to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term had not increased, in large part because recent global economic and financial developments had imparted some restraint to the economic outlook and placed further downward pressure on inflation in the near term. 
-0.5	The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets. 
-0.5	A number of participants noted that eliminating slack along such broader dimensions might require a temporary decline in the unemployment rate below its longer-run normal level, and that this development could speed the return of inflation to 2 percent.
-0.5	As a result, the appropriate path of the federal funds rate would be only modestly affected. 
-0.5	Members agreed that the Committee's evaluation of progress on its objectives would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. 
0.0	However, credit availability for borrowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document income, or high debt-to-income ratios remained tight.
-1.0	Recent information on real U.S. economic activity was generally stronger than expected, but equity prices declined, the foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated further, and indicators of foreign economic growth were generally weak. 
-0.5	Consumer sentiment in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers decreased in early September, reportedly in part because of the recent decline in stock market prices, but it remained above its year-earlier level.
-0.5	Developments in Financial Markets, Open Market Operations, and Policy Normalization
-0.5	The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. 
-0.5	Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to be rising moderately. 
-0.5	Underutilization of labor resources had diminished along a number of dimensions: The unemployment rate had fallen to a level close to most participants' estimates of its longer-run normal rate, and the numbers of discouraged workers and those employed part time for economic reasons had moved lower. 
-0.5	They also agreed to indicate that the Committee continued to anticipate that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it sees some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. 
-0.5	Daily take-up in the Desk's overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations declined somewhat, apart from month-ends, likely reflecting some increase in money market interest rates. 
-0.5	Most continued to see the risks to real activity and unemployment as nearly balanced, but many acknowledged that recent global economic and financial developments may have increased the downside risks to economic activity somewhat.
-0.5	Surveys continued to show stable longer-run inflation expectations, and most participants continued to anticipate that longer-run inflation expectations would remain well anchored. 
-0.5	Tighter financial market conditions and greater volatility contributed to a reduction of the odds that market participants appeared to place on the first increase in the federal funds rate occurring at the September FOMC meeting and to a flatter expected path for the policy rate thereafter. 
-0.5	And, while survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable, a couple of members expressed unease with the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period.
-0.5	The U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was a little weaker, on balance, than the one prepared for the July FOMC meeting. 
-0.5	In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. 
-0.5	Automakers scheduled further declines in assemblies over the remainder of the year, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, including readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, generally suggested that factory output would be little changed over that period. 
-0.5	The components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimates of PCE increased at a strong rate in July and August, and sales of light motor vehicles moved up in both months. 
-0.5	The unemployment rate was projected to run a little below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.
-0.5	The Committee reiterated its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.
-0.5	12-month changes in both the total and core PCE price indexes for August were expected to still be well below the Committee's 2 percent objective.

-0.5	Exports rose in July, supported by increased shipments of non-aircraft capital goods and automobiles, but remained subdued. 
-0.5	Similarly, results from the Desk's September Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indicated that, on average, respondents pushed out their expected timing of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.

-0.5	Over the 12 months ending in August, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) edged up, while the core CPI increased 1-3/4 percent. 
-0.5	Household credit performance was also favorable, with delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans low. 
-0.5	The substantial global supply of crude oil seemed likely to maintain downward pressure on energy prices for some time, leading to a deterioration in credit conditions for some U.S. producers and a further reduction in their capital outlays.
