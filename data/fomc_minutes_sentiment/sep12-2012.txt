0.0	Tarullo, John C. 
-0.5	More recently, the gains in average hourly earnings for all employees in July and August were small.
-0.5	The meeting adjourned at 12:10 p.m. on September 13, 2012.
-0.5	Prominent among these risks were a possible intensification of strains in the euro zone, with potential spillovers to U.S. financial markets and institutions and thus to the broader U.S. economy; a larger-than-expected U.S. fiscal tightening; and the possibility of a further slowdown in global economic growth. 
0.5	Employment rose slowly, and the unemployment rate was still high. 
-0.5	The Committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. 
-0.5	The August Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicated that overall interest-rate spreads on C&I loans were little changed; spreads on loans drawn on recently established commitments narrowed materially, although they remained wide.
-0.5	Near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers increased somewhat in August, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey edged up but remained within the narrow range that they have occupied for many years. 
-0.5	Many participants indicated a preference for replacing the calendar date with language describing the economic factors that the Committee would consider in deciding to raise its target for the federal funds rate. 
-0.5	It was noted that such increases, coupled with historically low mortgage rates, could lead to a stronger upturn in housing activity, although constraints on the capacity for loan origination and still-tight credit terms for some borrowers continued to weigh on mortgage lending.
0.0	Mr. 
-0.5	In China, export growth slowed, while retail sales and investment spending changed little. 
-0.5	In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participants' judgment of appropriate monetary policy. 
-0.5	On balance, the nominal Treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeeting period, with yields on longer-dated Treasury securities rising notably. 
0.0	The spread of yields on corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed. 
-0.5	One member dissented from the policy decision, on the grounds that he opposed additional asset purchases and preferred to omit the calendar date from the forward guidance; in his view, it would be better to use qualitative language to describe the factors that would influence the Committee's decision to increase the target federal funds rate.
-0.5	Some participants thought past purchases were useful because they were conducted during periods of market stress or heightened deflation risk and were less confident of the efficacy of additional purchases under present circumstances. 
-0.5	The information reviewed at the September 12-13 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to increase at a moderate pace in recent months. 
-0.5	It was noted that forward guidance along these lines would allow market expectations regarding the federal funds rate to adjust automatically in response to incoming data on the economy. 
0.5	Reports on manufacturing activity were mixed, with production related to autos and housing the most notable areas of relative strength. 
-0.5	In the agricultural sector, high grain prices and crop insurance payments were supporting farm incomes, helping offset declines in production and reduced profits on livestock. 
-0.5	Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. 
-0.5	Financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) market were still somewhat strained against a backdrop of weak fundamentals and tight underwriting standards. 
-0.5	Participants also discussed issues related to the provision of forward guidance regarding the future path of the federal funds rate. 
-0.5	A number of participants also observed that house prices were rising. 
-0.5	The Desk is also directed to begin purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month. 
-0.5	The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p.m
-0.5	Despite recent increases in the prices of some key commodities, consumer price inflation remained subdued. 
-0.5	Investment- and speculative-grade bond issuance increased in August from an already robust pace in preceding months, and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans rose further. 
-0.5	A number of participants also indicated that it could lift consumer and business confidence by emphasizing the Committee's commitment to continued progress toward its dual mandate. 
-0.5	In the euro area, policy developments contributed to an improvement in financial conditions; recent indicators pointed to further decreases in production, however, and both business and consumer confidence continued to decline. 
-0.5	Many participants also noted that a high level of uncertainty regarding the European fiscal and banking crisis and the outlook for U.S. fiscal and regulatory policies was weighing on confidence, thereby restraining household and business spending. 
-0.5	Later in the period, Treasury yields retraced some of their earlier gains as market participants' expectations of additional policy action increased following the release of the minutes of the August FOMC meeting, the Chairman's speech at the economic symposium in Jackson Hole, and the weaker-than-expected August employment report. 
-0.5	With regard to the forward guidance, the Committee agreed on an extension through mid-2015, in conjunction with language in the statement indicating that it expects that a highly accommodative stance of policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. 
-0.5	The trade data for July pointed toward real net exports having a roughly neutral effect on the growth of U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter after they made a positive contribution to the increase in real GDP in the second quarter.
-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. 
-0.5	At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
-0.5	Indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans were little changed, on balance, and initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially flat over the intermeeting period.
-0.5	Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and given the existing slack in resource utilization, inflation over the medium term would run at or below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent.
0.0	Meeting participants again discussed the extent of slack in labor markets. 
-0.5	Spreads of shorter-term yields on peripheral euro-area sovereign bonds over those on comparable-maturity German bunds declined substantially over the period. 
-1.0	These actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
-0.5	At this meeting, participants discussed possible formulations of the monetary policy assumptions on which to condition an FOMC consensus forecast and alternative approaches for participants to express their endorsement of the consensus forecast. 
0.5	Both starts and permits for new multifamily units rose in July. 
-0.5	Bank credit continued to expand at a moderate pace over the intermeeting period, as growth in C&I loans remained brisk while CRE and home equity loans both trended down further. 
0.0	The incoming information on inflation over the intermeeting period was largely in line with participants' expectations. 
-0.5	Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index fell in early August to levels not seen since the middle of 2007; it subsequently partially retraced. 
-0.5	The possibility of a larger-than-expected fiscal tightening in the United States and slower global growth were also seen as downside risks. 
-0.5	Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. 
-0.5	Several participants, while acknowledging some evidence of structural changes in the labor market, stated again that weak aggregate demand was the principal reason for the high unemployment rate. 
-0.5	Business contacts in many parts of the country were reported to be highly uncertain about the outlook for the economy and for fiscal and regulatory policies. 
-0.5	Inventories in most industries looked to be roughly aligned with sales in recent months.
-0.5	Private nonfarm employment increased in July and August at only a slightly faster pace than in the second quarter, and the rate of decline in government employment eased somewhat. 
-0.5	The U.S. international trade deficit was about unchanged in July after narrowing significantly in June. 
-0.5	The staff's medium-term projection for real GDP growth, which was conditioned on the assumption of no changes in monetary policy, was revised up a little, mostly reflecting a slight improvement in the outlook for the European situation and a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices. 
-0.5	Incoming data on factors that tend to support household spending were somewhat mixed. 
-0.5	If the public interpreted the statement pessimistically, consumer and business confidence could fall rather than rise. 
0.0	However, participants also observed that significant risks related to the euro-area banking and fiscal crisis remained, and that a number of important issues would have to be resolved in order to achieve further progress toward a comprehensive solution to the crisis. 
-0.5	Members generally judged that without additional policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. 
-0.5	While members generally viewed the potential risks associated with these purchases as manageable, the Committee agreed that in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, it would, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage-backed securities. 
0.0	However, consumer sentiment remained more downbeat in August than earlier in the year.
-0.5	If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. 
0.0	:
-0.5	Consumer prices excluding food and energy also were flat in July. 
-0.5	Finally, he preferred to omit the description of the time period over which exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate were likely to be warranted.
-0.5	The staff's broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined and benchmark sovereign yields in the major advanced foreign economies increased as safe-haven demands eased with the lessening of concerns about the European situation. 
-0.5	Participants indicated that recent decisions by the ECB helped ease investors' anxiety about the near-term prospects for the euro. 
-0.5	Other participants, by contrast, saw inflation risks as tilted to the downside, given their expectations for sizable and persistent resource slack.
-0.5	In addition, participants still saw significant downside risks to the outlook for economic growth. 
-0.5	Consumer price inflation stayed subdued, while measures of long-run inflation expectations remained stable.
-0.5	In addition to ongoing weakness in spending at the federal, state, and local government levels, uncertainties about tax and spending policies reportedly were restraining business decisionmaking. 
-0.5	In light of the discussion at the previous FOMC meeting, the subcommittee on communications developed a second experimental exercise intended to shed light on the feasibility and desirability of constructing an FOMC consensus forecast. 
-1.0	Along with the ongoing purchases of $45 billion per month of longer-term Treasury securities under the maturity extension program announced in June, these purchases will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, and should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. 
-0.5	That new language was meant to clarify that the maintenance of a very low federal funds rate over that period did not reflect an expectation that the economy would remain weak, but rather reflected the Committee's intention to support a stronger economic recovery. 
-0.5	With longer-term inflation expectations stable and the unemployment rate elevated, participants generally anticipated that inflation over the medium run would likely run at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate. 
0.0	Consensus Forecast Experiment
-0.5	The staff also did not find evidence that excessive risk-taking was widespread, although such behavior had appeared in a few smaller and less liquid markets.
-0.5	He also reported on System open market operations, including the ongoing reinvestment into agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of principal payments received on SOMA holdings of agency debt and agency-guaranteed MBS as well as the operations related to the maturity extension program authorized at the June 19-20, 2012, FOMC meeting. 
0.0	Lacker.
-0.5	By notation vote completed on August 21, 2012, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on July 31-August 1, 2012. 
-0.5	These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes.
-0.5	Home prices increased for the sixth consecutive month in July, and sales of both new and existing homes also rose.
-0.5	While significant uncertainty surrounds such estimates, the presentation indicated that asset purchases could be effective in fostering more rapid progress toward the Committee's objectives. 
-0.5	Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds picked up in August from the subdued pace in July, but net issuance continued to decline. 
-0.5	Following a couple of months when real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) were roughly flat, spending increased in July, and the gains were fairly widespread across categories of consumer goods and services. 
-0.5	The Committee agreed that it would closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months, and that if the outlook for the labor market did not improve substantially, it would continue its purchases of agency MBS, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. 
-0.5	The employment cost index increased a little more slowly than the measure of compensation per hour over the same period. 
0.5	Sentiment in financial markets improved notably during the intermeeting period. 
-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to continue the maturity extension program it announced in June to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of about $267 billion by the end of December 2012, and to sell or redeem Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less with a total face value of about $267 billion. 
-0.5	Refinancing activity increased but was still restrained by tight underwriting conditions, capacity constraints at mortgage originators, and low levels of home equity. 
0.0	However, the staff's projection for inflation over the medium term was little changed. 
-0.5	The staff's near-term forecast for inflation was revised up from the projection prepared for the August FOMC meeting, reflecting increases in consumer energy prices that were greater than anticipated. 
-0.5	Manufacturing production increased at a faster pace in July than in the second quarter, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization rose slightly. 
-0.5	In addition, numerical thresholds could be confused with the Committee's longer-term objectives, and so undermine the Committee's credibility. 
-0.5	The expansion in economic activity was expected to narrow the significant margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was anticipated to still be elevated at the end of 2014.
-0.5	Longer-term interest rates were low and supportive of economic growth, while equity prices had risen. 
-0.5	Regarding the economic outlook, participants generally agreed that the pace of the economic recovery would likely remain moderate over coming quarters but would pick up over the 2013-15 period. 
-0.5	In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. 
-1.0	Participants noted, however, that households were still in the process of deleveraging, confidence was low, and consumers appeared to remain particularly pessimistic about the prospects for the future, raising doubts that the somewhat stronger pace of spending would persist. 
-0.5	Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
-0.5	Participants also noted that if an agreement was not reached to tackle the expiring tax cuts and scheduled spending reductions, a sharp consolidation of fiscal policy would take place at the beginning of 2013.
0.5	This flexible approach was seen as allowing the Committee to tailor its policy response over time to incoming information while incorporating conditional features that clarified the Committee's intention to improve labor market conditions, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the action by helping to bolster business and consumer confidence. 
-0.5	The use of leverage by hedge funds was reported to have remained basically unchanged. 
0.0	Staff Review of the Financial Situation
-0.5	Moreover, participants observed that the pace of economic recovery would likely continue to be held down for some time by persistent headwinds, including continued weakness in the housing market, ongoing household sector deleveraging, still-tight credit conditions for some households and businesses, and fiscal consolidation at all levels of government. 
-0.5	A few participants felt that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over an extended period could unmoor longer-term inflation expectations and, against a backdrop of higher energy and commodity prices, posed upside risks to inflation. 
-0.5	The staff viewed the uncertainty around the forecast for economic activity as elevated and the risks skewed to the downside, largely reflecting concerns about the situation in Europe and the possibility of a more severe tightening in U.S. fiscal policy than anticipated. 
0.0	However, most participants thought these risks could be managed since the Committee could make adjustments to its purchases, as needed, in response to economic developments or to changes in its assessment of their efficacy and costs.
-0.5	In the September Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, respondents reported no significant changes in credit terms for important classes of counterparties over the past three months, although a few noted a slight easing in terms for some clients. 
-0.5	Inflation has been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently. 
-0.5	State and local government payrolls contracted in July and August, although at a somewhat slower rate than in the second quarter, and nominal construction spending by these governments decreased slightly in July.
-0.5	In the near term, the drought in the Midwest was expected to weigh on economic growth. 
0.5	The energy sector continued to expand. 
-0.5	A few participants, however, mentioned the possibility that economic growth could be more rapid than currently anticipated, particularly if major sources of uncertainty were resolved favorably or if faster-than-expected advances in the housing sector led to improvements in household balance sheets, increased confidence, and easier credit conditions. 
-0.5	Members agreed that such accommodation should be provided through both a strengthening of the forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate and purchases of additional agency MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month. 
-0.5	For the duration of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to suspend its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues. 
-0.5	Real federal government purchases appeared to decrease further, as data for nominal federal spending in July pointed to continued declines in real defense expenditures. 
-0.5	In particular, they expressed concerns about the risk that the exceptionally high level of long-term unemployment and the depressed level of labor participation could ultimately lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and prospects of those without jobs, thereby reducing the longer-run normal level of employment and potential output.
-0.5	Participants noted that indicators of financial stress in the United States were not especially high and overall conditions in U.S. financial markets remained favorable. 
-0.5	Although the level of activity in the housing sector remained low, the somewhat faster pace of home sales and construction provided some encouraging signs of improvement. 
0.0	Members also agreed to maintain the Committee's existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS into agency MBS. 
-0.5	In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
0.5	The available indicators pointed to continued weakness in overall labor market conditions. 
-0.5	The housing sector showed some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level. 
-0.5	Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus. 
-0.5	The continued rise in house values through July, and the increase in equity prices during the intermeeting period, suggested that households' net worth may have improved a little in recent months. 
-0.5	    To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. 
-0.5	To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. 
-0.5	    "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. 
-0.5	There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period.
-0.5	Although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain, the risks were viewed as balanced and not unusually high.
-0.5	The unemployment rate declined around the turn of the year but had not fallen significantly since then. 
0.0	Voting for this action: Ben Bernanke, William C. 
0.5	Following the August FOMC statement, Treasury yields moved up, reportedly in part because investors had factored in some probability that the anticipated liftoff date for the federal funds rate in the forward-guidance language would be moved back at that meeting. 
-0.5	The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.
0.0	Staff Review of the Economic Situation
-0.5	A number of participants highlighted the uncertainty about the overall effects of additional purchases on financial markets and the real economy. 
-0.5	In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally expressed concerns about the slow pace of improvement in labor market conditions and all members but one agreed that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for additional monetary accommodation. 
0.0	Staff Economic Outlook
-0.5	Powell, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Jeremy C. 
-0.5	Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. 
0.5	The monetary base rose in July and August as reserve balances and currency expanded.
0.5	Sentiment in financial markets improved somewhat since the time of the August FOMC meeting. 
-0.5	Exports declined in July, as decreases in the exports of industrial supplies, automotive products, and consumer goods were only partially offset by greater exports of agricultural products. 
-0.5	At the conclusion of the discussion, most participants agreed that the use of numerical thresholds could be useful to provide more clarity about the conditionality of the forward guidance but thought that further work would be needed to address the related communications challenges.
-0.5	    Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. 
-0.5	The staff also discussed the potential implications of additional asset purchases for the evolution of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and income. 
-0.5	The staff surveyed a wide range of asset markets and financial institutions for signs of excessive valuations, leverage, or risk-taking that could pose systemic risks. 
-0.5	The rate of economic growth rose in Brazil but was still sluggish, and increases in economic activity in Mexico were below the faster pace seen earlier in the year. 
-0.5	In addition, the labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratios were at or near post-recession lows.
-0.5	They saw slack in resource utilization as remaining wide, indicating an important role for additional policy accommodation. 
0.5	Real state and local government purchases also appeared to still be trending down. 
-0.5	Valuations for broad asset classes did not appear stretched, or supported by excessive leverage. 
-0.5	One participant, however, objected that purchases of MBS, when compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, would likely result in higher interest rates for many borrowers in other sectors. 
-0.5	Imports also declined in July, reflecting lower imports of capital goods and petroleum products and somewhat higher imports of automotive products. 
-0.5	Lacker dissented because he believed that additional monetary stimulus at this time was unlikely to result in a discernible improvement in economic growth without also causing an unwanted increase in inflation. 
-0.5	M2 growth was rapid in July, likely reflecting investors' heightened demand for safe and liquid assets amid concerns about the situation in Europe, but it slowed to a moderate pace in August as those concerns eased somewhat. 
-0.5	Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
-1.0	Equity prices for large domestic banks rose about in line with the broad equity price indexes, and credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the largest bank holding companies continued to move down.
-0.5	Although firms' balance sheets were generally strong, these uncertainties had led them to be particularly cautious and to remain reluctant to hire or expand capacity. 
-0.5	The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on July 31-August 1, 2012. 
-0.5	In addition, it was noted that additional purchases could reinforce the Committee's forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate. 
-0.5	Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Dennis P. 
0.0	Stein, Daniel K. 
0.0	Yellen.
-0.5	That approach could also bolster the stimulus provided by the System's holdings of longer-term securities. 
-0.5	The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons remained large, and the rate of long-duration unemployment continued to be high. 
-0.5	The unemployment rate was 8.1 percent in August, just a bit lower than its average during the first half of the year, and the labor force participation rate edged down further. 
-0.5	Conditions in unsecured short-term dollar funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period. 
-0.5	In addition, business contacts noted that export demand was showing signs of weakness as a result of the slowdown in economic activity in Europe. 
-0.5	One participant noted that an extended period of accommodation resulting from additional asset purchases could lead to excessive risk-taking on the part of some investors and so undermine financial stability over time. 
-0.5	Overall foreign economic growth appeared to be subdued in the third quarter after slowing in the second quarter. 
-0.5	Both nominal shipments and new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft declined in July, and the backlog of unfilled orders decreased. 
0.5	In conclusion, participants agreed to have a broad discussion of the experiences gathered from the two experimental exercises in conjunction with the October FOMC meeting.
-0.5	Nevertheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff expected that increases in real GDP would not materially exceed the growth of potential output in 2013. 
0.0	It was noted that clear communication and credibility allow the central bank to help shape the public's expectations about policy, which is crucial to managing monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound. 
0.0	However, respondents noted greater demand for funding of agency and non-agency residential MBS.
-0.5	Most global benchmark indexes for equity prices moved up, and the equity prices of European banks rose sharply. 
0.0	However, reaching agreement on specific thresholds could be challenging given the diversity of participants' views, and some were reluctant to specify explicit numerical thresholds out of concern that such thresholds would necessarily be too simple to fully capture the complexities of the economy and the policy process or could be incorrectly interpreted as triggers prompting an automatic policy response. 
-0.5	Committee Policy Action
-0.5	The rise in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector was muted over the year ending in the second quarter, and with small gains in productivity, unit labor costs rose only slightly. 
-0.5	The rate of gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms increased slightly in August but was still at a subdued level.
0.5	Participants again exchanged views on the likely benefits and costs of a new large-scale asset purchase program. 
-0.5	Lockhart, Sandra Pianalto, Jerome H. 
0.0	Most participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as roughly balanced. 
-0.5	Measures of labor compensation indicated that increases in nominal wages remained modest. 
-0.5	In secured funding markets, conditions were also little changed.
-0.5	The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level. 
-0.5	The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. 
-0.5	Many participants anticipated that such a program would provide support to the economic recovery by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and promoting more accommodative financial conditions. 
-0.5	Nevertheless, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities continued at a solid pace over the intermeeting period.
-0.5	It was also suggested that there was an ongoing process of polarization in the labor market, with the share of job opportunities in middle-skill occupations continuing to decline while the shares of low and high skill occupations increased. 
-0.5	Long-run inflation expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Survey of Professional Forecasters continued to be stable in the third quarter.
-0.5	The staff also reported on potential risks to financial stability, including those owing to the developments in Europe and to the current environment of low interest rates. 
-0.5	A few expressed skepticism that additional policy accommodation could help spur an economy that they saw as held back by uncertainties and a range of structural issues. 
1.0	Participants discussed the benefits of such an approach, including the potential for enhanced effectiveness of policy through greater clarity regarding the Committee's future behavior. 
-0.5	Investors' concerns about the situation in Europe seemed to ease somewhat, and market participants also appeared to have increased their expectations of additional monetary policy accommodation.
0.0	However, growth in employment had been slow, and almost all members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the Committee's mandate. 
-0.5	By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. 
-1.0	With crude oil prices expected to gradually decline from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought anticipated to be only temporary and comparatively small, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014.
0.0	However, others questioned the role of uncertainty about policy as a factor constraining aggregate demand. 
-0.5	Consumer price inflation had been subdued despite recent increases in the prices of some key commodities, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable.
0.5	A few participants reiterated their view that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the effect of structural factors, including mismatches across and within sectors between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available. 
-0.5	One participant noted that, while there were few current signs of excessive risk-taking, low interest rates could ultimately lead to financial imbalances that would be challenging to detect before they became serious problems.
-0.5	The presentation noted that significant additional asset purchases should not adversely affect the ability of the Committee to tighten the stance of policy when doing so becomes appropriate. 
0.0	Williams, and Janet L. 
-0.5	Funding conditions for euro-area banks improved, although these conditions remained fragile, and draws on the Federal Reserve's liquidity swap facility with the ECB fell.
0.5	Real disposable incomes increased solidly in July, boosted in part by lower energy prices. 
0.5	Real business expenditures on equipment and software appeared to be decelerating. 
-0.5	Inflation had been subdued, even though the prices of some key commodities had increased recently. 
-0.5	The staff presented an analysis of various aspects of possible large-scale asset purchase programs, including a comparison of flow-based purchase programs to programs of fixed size. 
0.0	Participants generally expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic activity over coming quarters. 
-0.5	Overall U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, were flat in July. 
0.0	However, automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies would be somewhat lower in the coming months than it was in July, and broader indicators of manufacturing activity, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, generally remained quite muted in recent months at levels consistent with only meager gains in factory output in the near term.
-0.5	In their discussion of the staff presentation, a few participants noted the uncertainty surrounding estimates of the effects of large-scale asset purchases or the need for additional work regarding the implications of such purchases for the normalization of policy.
-0.5	In one District, business surveys pointed to further growth; however, readings on forward-looking indicators of orders around the country were less positive.

-0.5	In discussing the costs and risks that such a program might entail, several participants reiterated their concern that additional purchases might complicate the Committee's efforts to withdraw monetary policy accommodation when it eventually became appropriate to do so, raising the risk of undesirably high inflation in the future and potentially unmooring inflation expectations. 
-0.5	Consistent with the slowing in foreign economic growth, readings on foreign inflation continued to moderate.
-0.5	Nonrevolving consumer credit continued to expand briskly in June, largely due to robust growth in student loans originated by the federal government, while revolving credit remained subdued. 
-0.5	Delinquency rates for consumer credit were still low, mostly reflecting a shift in lending toward higher-credit-quality borrowers.

-0.5	In the syndicated leveraged loan market, gross issuance of institutional loans continued to be solid in July and August. 
-0.5	A number of participants questioned the effectiveness of continuing to use a calendar date to provide forward guidance, noting that a change in the calendar date might be interpreted pessimistically as a downgrade of the Committee's economic outlook rather than as conveying the Committee's determination to support the economic recovery.

-0.5	In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015."
-0.5	The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.

-0.5	Although consumer spending had continued to advance, growth in business fixed investment appeared to have slowed.

-0.5	The drought was expected to reduce farm inventories and have a transitory impact on broader measures of economic growth.
-0.5	CDS spreads for debt issued by state governments moved lower over the intermeeting period, and the ratio of yields on long-term general obligation municipal bonds to yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities decreased, on balance.
-0.5	The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
-1.0	Participants' forecasts for economic activity, which in most cases were conditioned on an assumption of additional, near-term monetary policy accommodation, were also associated with an outlook for the unemployment rate to remain close to recent levels through 2012 and then to decline gradually toward levels judged to be consistent with the Committee's mandate.
-0.5	The staff noted that, for a flow-based program, the public's understanding of the conditions under which the Committee would end purchases would shape expectations of the magnitude of the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities, and thus also influence the financial and economic effects of such a program.

-0.5	In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the forecast for real GDP growth in the near term was broadly similar, on balance, to the previous projection. 
-0.5	Some participants suggested that, all else being equal, MBS purchases could be preferable because they would more directly support the housing sector, which remains weak but has shown some signs of improvement of late. 
0.0	Notation Vote
-0.5	Many participants thought that more-effective forward guidance could be provided by specifying numerical thresholds for labor market and inflation indicators that would be consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels. 
-0.5	Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
-0.5	The near-term forecast incorporated a larger negative effect of the drought on farm output in the second half of this year than the staff previously anticipated, but this effect was mostly offset by the staff's expectation of a smaller drag from net exports. 
-0.5	Consumer energy prices declined slightly in July, but survey data indicated that retail gasoline prices rose in August.
