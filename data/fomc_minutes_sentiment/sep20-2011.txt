0.0	Staff Economic Outlook
-0.5	Two members said that current conditions and the outlook could justify stronger policy action, but they supported undertaking the maturity extension program at this meeting as it did not rule out additional steps at future meetings. 
-0.5	Trade data for July suggested that net exports continued to boost U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter.
0.5	One member who opposed the maturity extension program also opposed the change in reinvestment policy because he judged that it would not benefit housing markets. 
-0.5	The effect of this change will be to keep the SOMA's holdings of agency securities at an approximately constant level; under the previous practice, those holdings were declining on an ongoing basis. 
-1.0	Initial claims for unemployment insurance edged up, on net, over the previous few weeks, and many indicators of firms' hiring plans deteriorated somewhat in recent months.
-0.5	Some judged that large-scale asset purchases and the resulting expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet would be more likely to raise inflation and inflation expectations than to stimulate economic activity and argued that such tools should be reserved for circumstances in which the risk of deflation was elevated. 
-0.5	The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p.m
-0.5	Private nonfarm employment rose only slightly in August, and job gains were weak even after adjusting for the effects of a strike by communications workers during the month. 
-0.5	The Committee discussed whether to specify the parameters of the maturity extension program by stating its intention to complete the full set of transactions by June 2012 or by stating that it would undertake these transactions at a specified monthly pace. 
-0.5	To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee decided to reinvest principal received from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS rather than continuing to reinvest in longer-term Treasury securities as had been the Committee's practice for more than a year. 
-0.5	Many judged that these policies could provide additional monetary policy accommodation by lowering longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions at a time when further reductions in the federal funds rate are infeasible. 
-0.5	Under the third option, the Committee would purchase longer-term Treasury securities, increasing the size of its balance sheet and the supply of reserve balances. 
-0.5	Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, and Charles I. 
-0.5	To implement the maturity extension program, the Desk would distribute purchases about evenly across nominal Treasury securities with 6 to 8 years to maturity, with 8 to 10 years to maturity, and with 10 to 30 years to maturity; the Desk would also buy a small amount of TIPS with remaining maturities of 6 to 30 years. 
-0.5	It also agreed to note that inflation appeared to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities had declined from their recent peaks, and that longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. 
-0.5	In addition, the federal funds market could contract as a result and the effective federal funds rate could become less reliably linked to other short-term interest rates. 
-0.5	Investors initially focused on the firmer forward guidance in the August FOMC statement indicating that the Committee anticipated that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. 
-0.5	With stable long-run inflation expectations and considerable slack in labor and product markets anticipated to persist over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued in 2012 and 2013.
-0.5	While noting that conditions in bank funding markets had tightened, particularly for European banks, participants observed that the capital and liquidity positions of U.S. banks had strengthened in recent quarters and that the credit quality of both business and household loans had continued to improve. 
-0.5	Temporary factors that had contributed to slower growth during the first half of the year had partly reversed, contributing to some rebound in final sales and production, particularly in the manufacturing sector where progress had been made in resolving supply chain disruptions. 
-0.5	Foreign economic growth declined in the second quarter. 
-0.5	Real federal government purchases appeared to increase in recent months as defense expenditures continued to rise from unusually low levels early in the year. 
-0.5	    The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
-0.5	Several participants again noted that the exceptionally high level of long-duration unemployment could lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and employment prospects of those affected and so reduce the economy's longer-run productive potential.
-0.5	Participants generally judged that there was relatively little risk of deflation. 
-0.5	Delinquency rates for several categories of consumer loans moved down further in recent months, with some reaching levels not seen since the 2008â€“09 recession began.
0.0	The Committee agreed that it was important to acknowledge, in the statement to be released following the meeting, that economic growth remained slow and that indicators pointed to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions. 
-0.5	Recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. 
-0.5	Residential mortgage debt contracted further in the second quarter, and the volume of mortgage applications to purchase homes moved down so far in the third quarter. 
0.0	Others thought this risk of misinterpretation could be managed through careful communications. 
-0.5	In his view, any reduction in long-term Treasury rates resulting from this policy action would likely lead to further hoarding by savers, with counterproductive results on business and consumer confidence and spending behaviors. 
-0.5	The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on August 9, 2011. 
-0.5	Moreover, both the average workweek and aggregate hours worked declined. 
0.0	Tarullo, and Janet L. 
-0.5	On the positive side, some participants noted that the reduction in leverage and increase in financial firms' liquidity cushions since the height of the financial crisis likely had attenuated the adverse effects of heightened risk aversion. 
0.0	Most members also supported a change in the Committee's reinvestment policy. 
-0.5	Equity prices in the euro area decreased over the intermeeting period, following sharp declines in early August. 
0.0	Looking ahead, participants continued to expect some pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters but anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only gradually. 
-0.5	    To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities. 
-0.5	C&I loans grew strongly, consumer loans showed tepid growth, and real estate loans continued to decline. 
-0.5	Several participants pointed to depressed home prices and financial constraints, including still-tight credit conditions for many households, as also likely to restrain consumer spending for a time. 
0.0	However, nominal retail sales, excluding purchases at motor vehicles and parts outlets, only inched up in August, and sales of new light motor vehicles ticked down. 
-0.5	This distribution would allocate a much larger share of purchases to longer maturities than was the case in the Committee's previous asset purchase programs. 
-0.5	Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
-0.5	By unanimous vote at that meeting, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions since the April 26-27, 2011 meeting, and by notation vote completed on July 11, 2011, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the June 21-22 FOMC meeting. 
0.5	Dealers also indicated that their clients' willingness to bear risk generally had declined somewhat; that was particularly true of hedge funds.
-0.5	Output also fell in Japan, reflecting the dislocations caused by the March earthquake. 
-1.0	Over subsequent weeks, weak economic data contributed to rising expectations of additional monetary accommodation; those expectations and increasing concerns about the financial situation in Europe led to an appreciable decline in intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasury yields. 
-0.5	Contacts at communications, technology, and transportation firms indicated that growth had slowed in those sectors; surveys also indicated that growth in the manufacturing sector had weakened during the summer. 
-0.5	Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods increased in July, and business purchases of new motor vehicles trended higher. 
-0.5	Businesses seemed to be adding to inventories at a more modest pace in July, as the re-stocking of motor vehicle inventories depleted by the earlier production disruptions was offset by slowing accumulation in other sectors. 
-0.5	Citing concerns over the global economic outlook, the central bank of Brazil reduced its policy rate after having raised it several times earlier this year. 
-0.5	In the discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, most members agreed that the revisions to the economic outlook warranted some additional monetary policy accommodation to support a stronger recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, was at a level consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. 
0.5	Most participants indicated that they favored taking steps to increase further the transparency of monetary policy, including providing more information about the Committee's longer-run policy objectives and about the factors that influence the Committee's policy decisions. 
0.5	Credit flows in August offered additional evidence that debt markets had become less hospitable to lower-rated nonfinancial firms. 
-0.5	Members also noted that the change in reinvestment policy could help prevent the shares of outstanding longer-term Treasury securities held by the Federal Reserve from reaching levels high enough to result in a deterioration in Treasury market functioning. 
-0.5	While they recognized that monetary policy alone could not completely address the economy's ills, most members judged that additional accommodation could contribute importantly to better outcomes in terms of the Committee's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. 
-0.5	Part of the downshift in global economic growth appeared to have been driven by temporary supply chain disruptions caused by Japan's earthquake. 
-0.5	Broad stock price indexes were volatile but increased, on net, since the August FOMC meeting, following sharp declines in the days just preceding that meeting. 
-0.5	The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.
-0.5	They judged that such a step could make the Committee's forward guidance more effective and increase the likelihood that financial markets would respond to incoming economic information in ways that would help monetary policy achieve its goals. 
0.0	Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. 
-0.5	Partly in reaction to the softer economic outlook, measures of inflation compensation for the next 5 years as well as 5 to 10 years ahead derived from nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities each fell to the low end of their ranges for this year.
0.5	Labor costs remained subdued.
-0.5	Three members concluded that additional accommodation was not appropriate at this time. 
-0.5	Exports rose briskly in July, particularly in industrial supplies and capital goods, after having decreased in June. 
-0.5	For many emerging market economies, the recent slowing in growth of economic activity was most evident in exports, industrial production, and other indicators of manufacturing activity. 
-0.5	Monthly U.S. consumer price inflation picked up in July and August after slowing in May and June, but remained a bit lower than earlier in the year. 
-0.5	In the medium term, the staff still projected real GDP to accelerate gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further increases in credit availability, and improvements in consumer and business confidence from their current low levels. 
0.0	However, some others noted that a recent change in deposit insurance assessments had the effect of significantly reducing the net return that many banks receive from holding reserve balances. 
-0.5	In addition, financial conditions deteriorated since the time of the previous forecast as investors pulled back from riskier assets. 
-0.5	Moreover, still-tight credit standards meant that many households were unable to qualify for loans to buy a home, and the drop in house prices in recent years left others unable to refinance an existing higher-rate mortgage. 
0.5	A majority favored the first approach. 
-0.5	Imports moved down in both months, as declines in petroleum products--reflecting both lower prices and decreased volumes--more than offset large gains in automotive products following the easing of supply chain disruptions in Japan. 
-0.5	Inflation abroad eased in the second quarter as the effects of earlier increases in food and energy prices began to fade. 
-0.5	The increase in real GDP was expected to be sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate only slowly over the projection period, and the jobless rate was anticipated to remain elevated at the end of 2013.
-0.5	This change in reinvestment policy was expected to help reduce the spread between yields on mortgage-backed securities and those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities seen this year and so contribute to lower mortgage rates. 
-0.5	Moreover, many participants voiced concerns that reducing the IOR rate risked costly disruptions to money markets and to the intermediation of credit, and that the magnitude of such effects would be difficult to predict in advance. 
-0.5	Meanwhile, employment at state and local governments declined further, reflecting their tight budget conditions. 
0.0	However, business investment in equipment and software continues to expand. 
-0.5	While they did not anticipate a downturn in economic activity, several remarked that, with growth slow, the recovery was more vulnerable to adverse shocks. 
0.5	Real business spending on equipment and software appeared to expand further. 
-0.5	Residential MBS yields and residential mortgage interest rates declined, on net, over the intermeeting period to historically low levels, but their spreads to yields on long-term Treasury securities increased. 
-0.5	Nonetheless, some large U.S. banks had seen further pressure on their stock prices and CDS spreads. 
-0.5	One commented that surveys showed that forecasters saw a low likelihood of deflation; a second, however, noted that a measure of the probability of deflation calculated from prices of Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) had declined as the Federal Reserve conducted its second large-scale asset purchase program but more recently had been rising.
-0.5	Near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers in August and September stayed well below the elevated level seen in the spring, and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.
-0.5	Nonresidential construction generally remained weak, apart from investment in extractive industries, and forward-looking indicators of nonresidential construction had dropped.
0.0	Plosser.
-0.5	In the economic forecast prepared for the September FOMC meeting, the staff lowered its projection for the increase in real GDP in the second half of 2011 and in the medium term. 
0.0	.
0.0	Mr. 
-0.5	Investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. 
-0.5	The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in June but narrowed significantly in July. 
-0.5	Nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that economic activity would increase more rapidly in the second half of this year than over the first half, as supply chain disruptions in the motor vehicle sector eased. 
0.0	However, it was noted that the ECB was providing ample liquidity to European banks, and that it had substantial capacity to provide additional liquidity through its lending facilities if necessary.
-0.5	Fisher saw a maturity extension program as providing few, if any, benefits in support of job creation or economic growth, while it could potentially constrain or complicate the timely removal of policy accommodation. 
-0.5	But stresses in global financial markets, sluggish growth in households' real incomes, and heightened uncertainty about economic prospects seemed to have contributed to lower consumer and business sentiment and to be weighing on economic growth. 
-0.5	Bond issuance by speculative-grade firms nearly came to a halt, and the volume of new leveraged loans financed by institutional investors appeared to drop sharply after having moved down in July. 
0.5	Recent indicators pointed to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remained elevated. 
-0.5	The Swiss National Bank took several steps to ease monetary policy, including intervening in the foreign exchange market to counter further appreciation of its currency and eventually announcing that it is prepared to buy unlimited quantities of foreign currency to prevent the Swiss franc from trading in the foreign exchange market at a rate below 1.2 Swiss francs per euro. 
-0.5	The options focused on ways to elucidate the economic conditions that could warrant raising the level of short-term interest rates. 
-0.5	Financing conditions for commercial real estate remained weak. 
-0.5	Yields on Italian and Spanish debt, which declined following reported ECB purchases in early August, drifted higher during the intermeeting period. 
-0.5	Household spending has been increasing at only a modest pace in recent months despite some recovery in sales of motor vehicles as supply-chain disruptions eased. 
0.5	Exports remained a bright spot for U.S. manufacturers and commodity producers. 
-0.5	More-pronounced declines in equity prices and larger increases in CDS spreads occurred for some European financial institutions. 
-0.5	Respondents noted that the use of financial leverage by hedge funds decreased somewhat over the same period. 
-0.5	Specifically, those members supported a program under which the Committee would announce its intention to purchase, by the end of June 2012, $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years and to sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less. 
-0.5	Fisher, Kocherlakota, and Plosser dissented because they did not support additional policy accommodation at this time. 
-0.5	The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm its anticipation that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. 
-0.5	In contrast, China continued to tighten its monetary policy, extending reserve requirements to a wider range of bank liabilities as it attempted to rein in off-balance-sheet lending by its banks.
-0.5	This program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. 
-0.5	Core commercial bank loans--the sum of commercial and industrial (C&I), real estate, and consumer loans--expanded slightly in July and August. 
-0.5	Some argued that the rise in core inflation from very low levels reflected the accommodative stance of monetary policy and indicated that the large-scale asset purchases the Committee undertook from November through June had been a successful response to the deflation risks of a year ago. 
-0.5	In addition, the Committee will maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.
-0.5	Participants agreed that, if European policymakers did not respond effectively, European sovereign debt and banking problems could intensify, with potentially serious spillovers to the U.S. economy. 
-0.5	Several commented that, with households and businesses seeking to reduce leverage rather than to borrow and with housing markets in distress, some of the normal mechanisms through which monetary policy actions are transmitted to the real economy appeared to be attenuated. 
-0.5	Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) slowed further in July and August, and investors appeared to demand greater compensation for risk. 
-0.5	At the same time, the Desk would sell, from the SOMA portfolio, Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 months to 3 years. 
-0.5	In contrast, survey measures of business conditions and sentiment remained at muted levels in August and September. 
0.0	However, several participants saw a risk that any explicit statement of economic conditions specified in the Committee's forward guidance could be mistaken for a statement of its longer-run objectives. 
-0.5	Financial markets were volatile over the intermeeting period as investors responded to mostly downbeat news on economic activity in the United States and abroad. 
-0.5	Risks included the possibility of more pronounced or more protracted deleveraging by households, the chance of a larger-than-expected near-term fiscal tightening, and potential spillovers to the United States if the financial situation in Europe were to worsen appreciably. 
-0.5	With the intensification of fiscal and financial stress in the euro area, measures of consumer and business confidence declined in August, and indicators of manufacturing activity in the region deteriorated. 
-0.5	Participants saw considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook for a gradual pickup in economic growth. 
-0.5	The Committee also directs the Desk to maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and to reinvest principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage-backed securities in order to maintain the total face value of domestic securities at approximately $2.6 trillion. 
-0.5	Contacts in the banking sector reported that U.S. banks remained willing to lend to qualified customers, but that loan demand was weak. 
-0.5	Many participants judged that weak demand was of most importance, while a few argued that structural and geographic mismatches were key. 
-0.5	Participants continued to see the outlook for growth and inflation as more uncertain than usual.
-0.5	Consumer energy prices stepped up in July and August but only partially retraced their decline over the previous two months, and the increases in food prices were somewhat below the pace seen early in the year. 
-0.5	The Committee intends to purchase, by the end of June 2012, $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years and to sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less. 
0.0	However, a number saw the potential effects on real economic activity as limited or only transitory, particularly in the current environment of balance sheet deleveraging, credit constraints, and household and business uncertainty about the economic outlook. 
-0.5	The European Central Bank continued to purchase, in the secondary market, sovereign debt of euro-area countries. 
-0.5	Even after adjusting for the effects of strikes on reported payrolls, the employment report for August showed weak job gains. 
-0.5	In commenting on the implications of a maturity extension program or another large-scale asset purchase program, several participants noted that the System should avoid holding a very large proportion of the outstanding stock of longer-term Treasury securities in its portfolio because the result could be a deterioration in market functioning. 
-0.5	The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. 
-0.5	Low confidence, continuing efforts to repair balance sheets, and heightened caution in the face of an uncertain economic environment were seen as factors likely to weigh on household spending. 
-0.5	Plosser felt that a maturity extension program would do little to improve near-term growth or employment, in light of the ongoing structural adjustments and fiscal challenges both in the United States and abroad. 
-0.5	The upward pressure on consumer prices from increases in import and commodity prices earlier in the year, along with the temporary boost to motor vehicle prices from low inventories, were expected to recede further in the coming quarters. 
-0.5	Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
0.0	:
0.0	However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
-0.5	    Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. 
-0.5	At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
-0.5	Moreover, in his view, with inflation continuing to run above earlier forecasts, such a program could risk adding unwanted inflationary pressures and complicate the eventual exit from the period of extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy.
-0.5	Several suggested that slowing growth in the United States and abroad made a new surge in commodity prices unlikely. 
-0.5	In the September 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, dealers reported only small changes in credit terms across major classes of counterparties over the past three months. 
-0.5	Business investment in equipment and software had continued to expand in recent months, but some contacts expressed concern that firms would cut capital spending if their sales slowed further.
-0.5	To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. 
-0.5	Participants generally agreed that a clear statement of the Committee's longer-run policy objectives could be helpful; some noted that it would also be useful to clarify the linkage between these longer-run objectives and the Committee's approach to setting the stance of monetary policy in the short and medium run. 
-0.5	Meanwhile, spending for drilling and mining structures increased further. 
0.0	Staff Review of the Economic Situation
0.0	Mr. 
-1.0	Contacts reported that slower growth, depressed business confidence, and uncertainty about the economic outlook were restraining hiring as well as capital investment; many also cited uncertainty about regulatory and tax policies as contributing to businesses' reluctance to spend. 
-0.5	Starts and permits for new single-family homes in July and August stayed near the very low levels seen since the middle of last year. 
0.0	Mr. 
-0.5	The meeting adjourned at 12:30 p.m. on September 21, 2011.
0.5	Industrial production expanded solidly but unevenly in July and August, and the manufacturing capacity utilization rate moved up. 
-0.5	It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, November 1-2, 2011. 
-0.5	Committee Policy Action
-0.5	Business sentiment had worsened, seemingly in response to weaker economic prospects and increased downside risks to the outlook for U.S. and global growth. 
-0.5	    To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee will now reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. 
-0.5	The unemployment rate remained at 9.1 percent in August, and both long-duration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons were still elevated. 
-0.5	More recently, however, increases in domestic food prices appeared to be pushing up consumer price inflation in some economies.
0.0	However, some noted that core as well as headline inflation had moved up, on balance, since last fall. 
-0.5	He also reported on System open market operations, including the continuing reinvestment into longer-term Treasury securities of principal payments received on SOMA holdings of agency debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS). 
-0.5	Growth slowed notably in Europe; economic activity also decelerated in the emerging market economies. 
-0.5	In addition, retail investors evidently placed redemptions from equity and bond mutual funds into bank deposits and retail money market funds.
-0.5	At the same time, the Committee decided to maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.
-0.5	Inflation appeared to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities declined from their peaks, but inflation had not yet come down as much as participants had expected earlier this year. 
-0.5	That said, a number of participants expressed concerns about the conceptual issues associated with establishing and communicating explicit longer-run objectives for the unemployment rate or other measures of labor market conditions, inasmuch as the long-run equilibrium levels of such measures are influenced importantly by nonmonetary factors, are subject to change over time, and are estimated with considerable uncertainty. 
0.0	Evans, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Daniel K. 
-0.5	    Secretary's Note: The following information regarding the June 21-22, 2011 FOMC meeting was inadvertently omitted from previous minutes. 
-0.5	    "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. 
-0.5	Participants noted modest growth in consumer spending on average in recent months, with some rebound in purchases of new motor vehicles as manufacturers made progress in resolving supply chain disruptions and increased the availability of popular models. 
0.5	In contrast, business contacts reported that commodity-related sectors such as energy, agriculture, and mining continued to show strong gains; tourism also appeared to be doing well. 
-0.5	He felt that policymakers should instead focus their attention on improving the monetary policy transmission mechanism, particularly with regard to the activity of community banks, which are vital to small business lending and job creation. 
-0.5	Prices of money market futures contracts indicated that monetary policy was expected to become more accommodative in both the euro area and the United Kingdom. 
-0.5	Activity in the housing market continued to be depressed by weak demand, uncertainty about future home prices, tight credit conditions for mortgages and construction loans, and a substantial inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties. 
-0.5	They expected this program to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and to help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. 
-1.0	Motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to rise noticeably in September and then increase further in the fourth quarter, but broader indicators of near-term manufacturing activity, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, remained at levels consistent with only meager gains in output in the coming months.
-0.5	Output increased markedly at both motor vehicle manufacturers and their upstream suppliers as the supply chain disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan eased. 
0.0	Voting against this action: Richard W. 
-0.5	The information reviewed at the September 20-21 meeting indicated that economic activity continued to expand at a slow pace and that labor market conditions remained weak. 
-0.5	In most industries, inventories looked to be reasonably well aligned with sales.
-0.5	Real GDP contracted in Canada due to a large decline in exports. 
-0.5	The foreign exchange value of the dollar increased over the intermeeting period, reflecting a flight to safety that also contributed to lower benchmark sovereign yields in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada. 
-0.5	A number of participants suggested that the Committee's periodic Summary of Economic Projections could be used to provide more information about their views on the longer-run objectives and the likely evolution of monetary policy.
0.0	However, low mortgage rates spurred little refinancing activity, in part because of tight underwriting standards and low levels of home equity for many households. 
-0.5	The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability." 
-0.5	Although the waning of these disruptions seemed to be supporting a rebound in foreign GDP growth in the third quarter, recent indicators suggested only sluggish gains in underlying economic activity. 
-0.5	Since November, inflation, and the one-year-ahead forecast for inflation, had risen, while unemployment, and the one-year-ahead forecast for unemployment, had fallen. 
-0.5	Most participants agreed that inflation appeared to have moderated in recent months compared with earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities declined from their peaks, though the moderation was not as substantial as many participants had expected. 
-0.5	With respect to the MBS reinvestment program, the Desk would concentrate purchases in newly issued agency-backed MBS and would conduct purchases through a competitive bidding process.
-0.5	M2 surged in July and August, as investors and asset managers sought the relative safety and liquidity of bank deposits and other assets that make up the M2 aggregate. 
-0.5	Surveys suggested that households were pessimistic about their future incomes, and consumer confidence had dropped to historically low levels. 
-0.5	One participant suggested that hurricanes and subsequent flooding had contributed to the slowing in some parts of the country. 
0.0	Staff Review of the Financial Situation
-0.5	They generally judged that risks to the growth outlook, including strains in global financial markets, were significant and tilted to the downside; moreover, slow growth left the recovery more vulnerable to negative shocks. 
0.5	Rates of serious mortgage delinquency continued to moderate but remained high, while the rate at which prime mortgages moved into delinquency stepped up, on balance, in recent months.
-0.5	The staff gave a presentation on several tools that could be used, within the Committee's current policy framework, to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to support the economic recovery. 
-0.5	Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms weakened substantially in recent weeks, and a large number of planned initial public offerings were shelved amid the heightened market volatility.
-0.5	Some business contacts reported that their firms had made contingency plans to reduce output and employment if demand for their products were to turn down. 
-0.5	Under the first of these options, the Federal Reserve would reinvest the principal payments it receives on its holdings of agency securities exclusively in long-term Treasury securities. 
-0.5	Issuance of consumer asset-backed securities moved down in August, but spreads on these securities remained low. 
0.0	Participants generally agreed that they needed more information on the likely effects of a reduction in the IOR rate in order to judge its usefulness as a policy tool in the current environment.
-0.5	Average hourly earnings for all employees posted a small gain, on net, over July and August, and their rate of increase from 12 months earlier remained subdued.
-0.5	The staff also summarized a set of options for clarifying, for the public, the Committee's longer-run objectives under its dual mandate as well as the Committee's forward guidance about the likely future stance of monetary policy. 
-0.5	A number of participants judged that a reduction would result in at least marginally lower money market rates and could help stimulate bank lending.

-0.5	Accordingly, many felt that if the Committee were to reach a consensus on more explicit statements of its longer-run objectives, it would need to provide an in-depth explanation to the public of how those objectives were determined and how they fit into the policymaking framework. 
-0.5	Some participants observed that keeping the IOR rate noticeably above the market rate on other safe, short-term instruments could be perceived as subsidizing some banking institutions.
