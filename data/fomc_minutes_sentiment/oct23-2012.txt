-0.5	Household spending advanced more quickly in recent months than during the spring, and housing activity showed further signs of improvement.

0.0	The unemployment rate declined but was still elevated. 
-0.5	One participant, however, reported that contacts said that insufficient demand remained their principal concern. 
0.0	However, construction activity remained at a relatively low level, reflecting the restraint imposed by tight credit standards for mortgage borrowing and by the large inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties.

-0.5	Foreign equity indexes, which generally rose following the September FOMC statement, ended the intermeeting period higher in most markets, although stock prices in the euro area were down on net.

0.0	Thresholds and Forward Guidance
-1.0	These actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

-0.5	    "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. 
-0.5	For example, several participants reported that lenders' capacity for processing home-purchase mortgages was tight and backlogs were long, in part due to the current heavy pace of refinancings. 
0.0	However, one member continued to object to the calendar-date-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate. 
-0.5	The pace of investment- and speculative-grade bond issuance by nonfinancial firms picked up significantly in September from the already robust pace in previous months.

-0.5	Automakers' schedules pointed to a similar rate of motor vehicle assemblies in the fourth quarter as in the third quarter. 
0.5	Consumer food prices rose modestly in recent months.

-0.5	A staff presentation focused on the potential effects of using specific threshold values of inflation and the unemployment rate to provide forward guidance regarding the timing of the initial increase in the federal funds rate. 
-0.5	In addition, lower mortgage rates had spurred a rise in refinancing activity, which, along with the increases in household wealth attributable to higher home values and equity prices, would provide support for consumer spending going forward.
-0.5	Several participants mentioned that the cautious posture of businesses was apparent in national and regional surveys of plans of both large and small firms. 
0.0	However, most participants judged that, given the diversity of their views about the economy's structure and dynamics, it would be difficult for the Committee to agree on a fully specified longer-term path for monetary policy to incorporate into a quantitative consensus forecast in a timely manner, especially under present conditions in which the policy decision comprises several elements.

0.5	Sales of motor vehicles remained an area of strength, in part due to favorable credit conditions.

-0.5	For example, yields on MBS dropped noticeably, leading to a decline in mortgage interest rates, and corporate bond yields generally moved lower. 
-1.0	In the farm sector, however, drought conditions likely reduced inventory accumulation last quarter and subtracted from overall economic growth.

-0.5	Conditions in unsecured dollar funding markets appeared to improve some. 
-0.5	The Committee judged that continuing both the purchases of MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and the existing program to extend the average maturity of its Treasury securities holdings remained appropriate. 
-0.5	In addition to the uncertainty about the fiscal outlook, manufacturing contacts attributed the weakness in orders and production to softer export demand; one participant added that agricultural exports had also softened. 
-0.5	The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons increased somewhat and continued to be elevated, while the rate of long-duration unemployment edged down further but remained high.

-0.5	Participants saw recent price developments as consistent with inflation remaining at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium run. 
-1.0	The Manager also reported on System open market operations over the intermeeting period, focusing on the ongoing reinvestment into agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of principal payments received on SOMA holdings of agency debt and agency-guaranteed MBS and the purchases of MBS authorized at the September FOMC meeting. 
-0.5	Although energy prices had risen sharply in recent months, reflecting earlier increases in crude oil costs and supply disruptions, gasoline prices were anticipated to move back down in coming months as those pressures eased.

-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to continue the maturity extension program it announced in June to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of about $267 billion by the end of December 2012, and to sell or redeem Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less with a total face value of about $267 billion.

-0.5	House prices continued to rise, and some indicators of credit quality on residential real estate loans improved. 
-0.5	Concerning developments in the household sector, participants observed that the recent news on consumer spending and confidence had been positive, with surveys reporting that households had become noticeably more optimistic about the outlook for unemployment and income. 
0.0	However, longer-term inflation expectations were stable, and over the medium run, inflation was anticipated to run at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective.
-0.5	It was noted that such guidance could have significant effects on financial conditions and the economy. 
-0.5	Bank credit continued to expand at a moderate rate in the third quarter, with further growth in loans augmented by larger gains in securities holdings. 
0.0	Several participants noted that their contacts were concerned not only about the economic slowdown in Europe, but also about whether the recent slowing in economic activity in Asia might persist.
-0.5	Many participants were of the view that adopting quantitative thresholds could, under the right conditions, help the Committee more clearly communicate its thinking about how the likely timing of an eventual increase in the federal funds rate would shift in response to unanticipated changes in economic conditions and the outlook. 
-0.5	Accordingly, all but one member judged that maintaining the current, highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. 
-0.5	In contrast to the more favorable news on consumer spending and housing, contacts generally reported slower activity in the business sector. 
0.0	However, others saw the effect on expected inflation as relatively muted or likely the result of reduced risks of undesirably low inflation.

-0.5	Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
-0.5	Another open question was whether to supplement thresholds expressed in terms of the unemployment rate and inflation with additional indicators of economic and financial conditions that might signal a need either to raise the federal funds rate before a threshold is crossed or to delay until well afterward. 
0.5	Looking ahead, a number of participants indicated that additional asset purchases would likely be appropriate next year after the conclusion of the maturity extension program in order to achieve a substantial improvement in the labor market.

-0.5	In contrast, consumer sentiment rose in September and early October, and continued modest increases in house prices added to households' net worth.
-0.5	These issues included whether to specify such thresholds in terms of realized or projected values of inflation and the unemployment rate and, in either case, what values for those thresholds would best balance the Committee's objectives of promoting maximum employment and price stability. 
-0.5	Accordingly, thresholds could increase the probability that market reactions to economic developments would move longer-term interest rates in a manner consistent with the Committee's view regarding the likely future path of short-term rates. 
-0.5	Real disposable income declined in August, largely reflecting the effect of higher consumer energy prices.
