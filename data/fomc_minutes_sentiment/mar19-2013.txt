0.5	In their discussion of this topic, meeting participants generally judged the macroeconomic benefits of the current purchase program to outweigh the likely costs and risks, but they agreed that an ongoing assessment of the benefits and costs was necessary. 
-0.5	Some participants also were concerned that additional asset purchases could complicate the eventual firming of policy--for example, by impairing the Committee's control over the federal funds rate. 
0.0	Such a decision was also seen by some as a potential source of additional near-term policy accommodation. 
0.0	Voting for this action: Ben Bernanke, William C. 
-0.5	Rising house prices were strengthening household balance sheets by raising wealth and by increasing the ability of some homeowners to refinance their mortgages at lower rates. 
-0.5	Despite the increase in mortgage rates since the start of the year, mortgage refinancing originations declined only slightly.
-0.5	In contrast, the monetary base expanded briskly from January through mid-March, driven mainly by the increase in reserve balances resulting from the Federal Reserve's purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS.
-0.5	Firms reported increased planning for capital expenditures, supported by low interest rates and substantial cash holdings. 
-0.5	Many participants noted that in the current low-interest rate environment, investors in some financial markets were taking on additional risk--either credit risk or interest rate risk--in an effort to boost returns. 
0.0	A range of views was expressed regarding the economic and labor market conditions that would call for an adjustment in the pace of purchases. 
-0.5	Recent data for European economies, including retail sales and purchasing managers indexes, suggest that the rate of economic contraction may have diminished since the beginning of the year. 
-0.5	Most participants remarked on the federal spending sequester and its potential effects on the economy; they judged that recent tax and spending changes were already restraining aggregate demand or would do so over the course of the year. 
-0.5	The Committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels that the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. 
-0.5	Participants generally anticipated that growth would proceed at a moderate pace and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward levels consistent with the Committee's mandate. 
-0.5	A couple of participants noted that U.S. banks had expanded their capital positions and were generally in sound financial condition. 
-0.5	Real state and local government purchases looked to have declined as nonfederal government payrolls decreased in January and February and nominal construction expenditures fell in January.
-0.5	Moreover, to the extent that asset purchases push down longer-term interest rates, they potentially expose financial markets to a rapid rise in those rates in the future, which could impose significant losses on some investors and intermediaries. 
-0.5	Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive. 
-0.5	Real federal government purchases appeared to decrease further in January and February, as defense spending continued to contract on balance. 
-0.5	Inflation had been running below the Committee's 2 percent objective for some time, and nearly all of the participants anticipated that it would run at or below 2 percent over the medium term.
-0.5	Review of Efficacy and Costs of Asset Purchases
-0.5	Some participants were concerned that a substantial decline in remittances might lead to an adverse public reaction or potentially undermine Federal Reserve credibility or effectiveness.

-0.5	The staff viewed the uncertainty around its forecast for economic activity as similar to the average level over the past 20 years. 
-0.5	A few participants felt that MBS purchases provided more support to the economy than purchases of longer-term Treasury securities because they stimulated the housing sector directly; however, a few preferred to focus any purchases in the Treasury market to avoid allocating credit to a specific sector of the economy. 
-0.5	Conditions in domestic and offshore dollar funding markets were generally little changed, on balance, during the intermeeting period. 
0.0	Conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector improved somewhat. 
-1.0	Some key factors that tend to influence household spending were mixed: Households' real disposable incomes declined in January, reflecting in part the increases in both payroll and income taxes that went into effect at the beginning of the year and the previous pulling forward of taxable income from 2013 into 2012; in contrast, household net worth likely rose in recent months as a result of higher equity values and home prices. 
-0.5	In particular, the current stance of policy could lead to financial imbalances, a mispricing of risk, and, over time, higher long-term inflation expectations. 
-0.5	This caution appeared to have resulted in jobs remaining vacant for substantially longer than would normally be the case, given the unemployment rate.
0.0	A few participants raised the possibility of an undesirable rise in inflation. 
-0.5	The Committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates. 
-0.5	Measures of labor compensation indicated that gains in nominal wages remained relatively slow, only slightly above the rate of price inflation. 
-0.5	Their views on the practical importance of these risks varied, as did their prescriptions for mitigating them. 
0.5	Many participants emphasized that any decision to reduce the pace of purchases should reflect both an improvement in their overall outlook for labor market conditions, as implied by a wide range of available indicators, and their confidence in the sustainability of that improvement.

-0.5	Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and slack in resource utilization remaining, inflation over the medium term would likely run at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective.
-0.5	Measures of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities edged down over the period.
-0.5	Both fiscal restraint and the high level of student debt were mentioned as risks to aggregate household spending over the forecast period.
-0.5	Although the Committee's asset purchases have had little apparent effect on securities market functioning to date, some participants felt that future asset sales could prove more challenging. 
-0.5	Many participants, including some of those who were focused on the increasing risks, expressed the view that continued solid improvement in the outlook for the labor market could prompt the Committee to slow the pace of purchases beginning at some point over the next several meetings, while a few participants suggested that economic conditions would likely justify continuing the program at its current pace at least until late in the year.

-0.5	Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased moderately in January and February. 
-0.5	A couple of these participants noted that if progress toward the Committee's economic goals were not maintained, the pace of purchases might appropriately be increased. 
-0.5	    "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests a return to moderate economic growth following a pause late last year. 
-0.5	Nonetheless, delinquency rates on loans underlying existing CMBS remained near historically high levels in February, and CRE prices flattened out in the fourth quarter after several quarters of increases.
-0.5	Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. 
-0.5	Financial market concerns regarding the euro area rose over the intermeeting period amid weaker-than-expected economic data releases and political uncertainties generated by the inconclusive election results in Italy. 
-0.5	The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual.
-0.5	    To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. 
-0.5	Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were unchanged in February and early March; longer-term inflation expectations in the survey were also little changed and remained within the narrow range that they have occupied for some time.
-0.5	Such a dynamic was seen as potentially leading to a virtuous cycle that could help support household spending and financial market conditions over time. 
-0.5	With economic data for the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada coming in weaker than anticipated, yields on bunds, gilts, and long-term Canadian government securities fell. 
0.5	Nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a solid pace because of growth in student and auto loans, while revolving credit was roughly flat.

-0.5	The staff also reported on potential risks to financial stability, including those associated with the current low interest rate environment. 
-0.5	Participants noted that the housing market, in particular, had firmed somewhat further. 
-0.5	In particular, participants pointed to possible risks to the stability of the financial system, the functioning of particular financial markets, the smooth withdrawal of monetary accommodation when it eventually becomes appropriate, and the Federal Reserve's net income. 
-0.5	Option-implied volatility for the S&P 500 index over the near term rose slightly but remained low, at levels last seen in early 2007.

-0.5	The expected path for the federal funds rate implied by market quotes moved down over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting policymakers' communications that reinforced market expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation. 
-0.5	The Committee agreed that it would be appropriate to continue purchases of MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and purchases of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month, as well as to maintain the Committee's reinvestment policies. 
0.5	Issuance of consumer asset-backed securities remained strong.
-0.5	The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. 
-0.5	Yields on nominal Treasury securities were modestly lower, on net, over the intermeeting period.

-0.5	One participant emphasized the role of recent asset purchases in keeping inflation from declining further below the Committee's longer-run goal. 
-0.5	In any case, it was indicated that the fiscal benefits of a stronger economy would be much greater than any short-term fluctuations in remittances, and moreover, a couple of participants noted that cumulative remittances to the Treasury would likely be higher than would have been the case without any asset purchases.

-0.5	Reports from homebuilders in many parts of the country were encouraging. 
-0.5	Participants judged that the economy had returned to moderate growth following a pause late last year, and a few noted that the downside risks may have diminished.

0.0	Staff Economic Outlook
-0.5	In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members saw the economic outlook as little changed since the previous meeting, and, consequently, all but one member judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. 
-1.0	It was also noted that the accommodative stance of policy could be supporting financial stability by returning the economy to a stable footing sooner than would otherwise be the case and perhaps by allowing borrowers to secure longer-term financing and thereby reduce funding risks; by contrast, curtailing asset purchases could slow the recovery and so extend the period of very low interest rates. 
-0.5	Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
0.5	Participants generally agreed that asset purchases also have potential costs and risks. 
-0.5	A decision not to sell MBS, or to sell MBS only very slowly, would also mitigate some of the financial stability risks that could be associated with such sales as well as damp the decline in remittances to the Treasury at that time. 
-0.5	There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period.
-0.5	More-recent indicators suggest that economic activity in China has slowed some. 
-0.5	Although inflows into emerging market mutual funds continued, they slowed notably in recent weeks, and EME equity indexes were, on average, slightly lower. 
-0.5	In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy. 
0.5	A few participants noted that they already viewed the costs as likely outweighing the benefits and so would like to bring the program to a close relatively soon. 
-0.5	In their discussion of the household sector, most participants noted that the data on spending were somewhat encouraging, particularly with regard to spending on automobiles, other consumer durables, and housing. 
0.5	Indexes of overall U.S. consumer prices were little changed in January but the consumer price index moved up briskly in February, largely reflecting a sharp rise in gasoline prices. 
-0.5	After picking up in January, gross public issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms remained strong in February, and issuance of collateralized loan obligations reached a post-financial-crisis high.
-0.5	In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. 
-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. 
-0.5	Accommodative monetary policy was likely providing important support to these developments. 
0.5	In light of their discussion of the benefits and costs of asset purchases, participants discussed their views on the appropriate course for the current asset purchase program. 
-0.5	Labor market conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate remains elevated. 
-0.5	Real business expenditures on equipment and software appeared to slow somewhat early this year after rising at a brisk rate in the fourth quarter.

0.5	When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
-1.0	A couple of participants noted that the increase in the payroll tax appeared to have not yet had a material effect on household spending; however, another suggested that the payroll tax increase, along with higher gasoline prices, may be one reason why spending by lower-income households appeared to be depressed, as those changes disproportionately cut into the disposable income of those households. 
-0.5	It was noted that, in addition to the standard channels through which monetary policy affects the economy, asset purchases could help signal the Committee's commitment to accommodative monetary policy, thereby making the forward guidance about the federal funds rate more effective. 
-0.5	Spending by households and businesses was continuing to expand, perhaps reflecting some increased optimism. 
-0.5	Many participants reported that their business contacts were seeing some further improvement in the economic outlook. 
-0.5	Private nonfarm employment increased at a modest rate in January but expanded more briskly in February, while government employment continued to decrease. 
0.5	Investment spending on productivity-enhancing technology was strong, as was pipeline construction in the energy sector.

-0.5	George dissented because she continued to view monetary policy as too accommodative and therefore as posing risks to the achievement of the Committee's economic objectives in the long run. 
-0.5	In general, reflecting the limited experience with large-scale asset purchases, participants recognized that estimates of the economic effects were necessarily imprecise and covered a wide range.
-1.0	Expectations intensified that the Bank of Japan would pursue aggressive monetary easing after the new governor of the Bank of Japan was installed; over the intermeeting period, the yen depreciated further, 10-year Japanese government bond yields declined to near record lows, and the Nikkei stock price index rose substantially. 
-0.5	Other forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, also suggested that outlays for business equipment would rise in the coming months. 
-0.5	Commercial mortgage debt increased in the fourth quarter after having decreased in each quarter since the beginning of 2009, and commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) issuance continued to be robust over the intermeeting period.

-0.5	Consumer food prices were flat in January and only edged up in February. 
-0.5	Powell, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Eric Rosengren, Jeremy C. 
-0.5	The staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the January FOMC meeting. 
-0.5	One participant cited research indicating that long-term unemployment, which is currently especially high, could lead to persistently lower income and wealth for those affected, even after they found jobs. 
0.5	Dudley, James Bullard, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. 
-0.5	One participant suggested that the signaling effect of asset purchases may have been reduced by the adoption of threshold-based forward guidance.

-0.5	The staff provided presentations covering the efficacy of the Federal Reserve's asset purchases, the effects of the purchases on security market functioning, the ways in which asset purchases might amplify or reduce risks to financial stability, and the fiscal implications of purchases. 
-0.5	In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. 
-0.5	Nevertheless, a number of participants remained concerned about the potential for financial stability risks to build. 
0.5	Private-sector employment increased at a fairly solid pace, on balance, and the unemployment rate, though still elevated, was slightly lower in February than in the fourth quarter of last year. 
-0.5	Meeting participants generally agreed that there was an ongoing need to evaluate the possible interactions between monetary policy decisions and financial stability, with some noting that adverse shocks to financial stability can affect progress toward the Committee's dual mandate.
-0.5	Overall, a broad index of U.S. bank equity prices rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, and credit default swap spreads for most large domestic banks edged down on balance.
0.0	George.

-0.5	Inference about the labor force participation rate was complicated by its long-run downward trend. 
0.5	The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. 
-0.5	More broadly, firms reportedly remained cautious about hiring, which some participants attributed in part to restrictive fiscal policy combined with growing regulatory burden. 
-1.0	Low interest rates likely have supported gains in asset prices and encouraged the flow of credit to households and businesses, but these changes to date do not appear to have been accompanied by significant financial imbalances. 
-0.5	    Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. 
-0.5	Several participants stated that the moderate acceleration in spending might in part reflect pent-up demand following years of deleveraging and was importantly supported by the stance of monetary policy, which has reduced the cost of financing purchases and improved credit availability to some degree. 
-0.5	Several participants suggested that enhanced supervision could serve to limit, at least to some extent, the increased risk-taking associated with a lengthy period of low long-term interest rates, and that effective policy communication or balance sheet management by the Committee could reduce the probability of excessively rapid increases in longer-term rates. 
-0.5	A few participants noted that curtailing the purchase program was the most direct way to mitigate the costs and risks.
-0.5	Market reaction to the results of the Dodd-Frank Act annual stress tests and of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review was limited. 
-0.5	Committee Policy Action

-1.0	Ten-year sovereign yields in most peripheral euro-area countries rose relative to German bond yields, with spreads for Italian sovereign debt increasing noticeably; euro-area banking-sector share prices fell sharply. 
-0.5	Generally favorable U.S. economic data releases, along with communications from Federal Reserve policymakers regarding the outlook for the economy and monetary policy, appeared to contribute to improved sentiment in domestic financial markets over the intermeeting period despite some renewed concerns about economic and financial conditions in Europe.
0.0	However, a few participants were not convinced of the benefits of asset purchases, stating that the effects on financial markets appeared to be short lived or that they saw little evidence of a significant macroeconomic effect. 
-0.5	Asset purchases were seen by some as having a potential to contribute to imbalances in financial markets and asset prices, which could undermine financial stability over time. 
-0.5	Members stressed that any changes to the purchase program should be conditional on continuing assessments both of labor market and inflation developments and of the efficacy and costs of asset purchases.

-0.5	But a few participants noted that the risk remained that inflationary pressures could rise as the expansion continued, especially if monetary policy remained highly accommodative for too long.
-0.5	Overall, most meeting participants thought the risks and costs of additional asset purchases remained manageable, but also that continued close attention to these issues was warranted. 
-0.5	The rate of long-duration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons were little changed, on net, and both measures remained high. 
-0.5	Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds rose a bit over the intermeeting period, leaving risk spreads a little wider.

-0.5	In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. 
-0.5	A couple of other participants thought that overall consumer spending was likely still held back, at least in part, by ongoing concerns about future income and employment prospects.

0.5	Sales of both new and existing homes advanced in January, and home prices increased further.
-0.5	Corporate bond issuance by nonfinancial firms remained fairly robust in February; commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and nonfinancial CP also continued to expand. 
-0.5	Driven largely by continued growth in C&I loans, total bank credit expanded in January and February at roughly its fourth-quarter pace. 
-0.5	One consequence of asset purchases has been the increase in the Federal Reserve's net income and its remittances to the Treasury, but those values were projected to decline, perhaps even to zero for a time, as the Committee eventually withdraws policy accommodation. 
-0.5	A number of participants suggested that the Committee could change the mix of its policy tools if necessary to increase or maintain overall accommodation, including potentially adjusting its forward guidance or its balance sheet policies.
-1.0	With crude oil prices anticipated to trend down slowly from their current levels, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2015.
0.0	However, trends in a few specific markets bore watching, and the staff will continue to monitor for signs of developments that could pose risks to financial stability.
-0.5	The rate of private-sector hiring, along with indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans, were generally subdued and were consistent with continued moderate increases in employment in the coming months.
-1.0	Fiscal policy restraint on economic growth was assumed to ease over time, and real GDP was projected to accelerate gradually in 2014 and 2015, supported by increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy. 
-0.5	Imports rose in January, largely reflecting a rebound in the value of oil imports, and exports decreased, driven by a decline in the value of exports of petroleum products. 
-0.5	Participants saw little near-term inflationary pressure, with a few noting that the appreciation of the dollar was holding down import costs or that the recent increases in gasoline prices did not appear to have passed through more broadly to prices of other goods. 
-0.5	Manufacturing production increased strongly in February after declining in January, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization in February was a little higher than in the fourth quarter. 
-0.5	These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes.
-0.5	The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in December but widened in January. 
-0.5	In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.
0.5	Participants generally saw conditions in the housing market as having improved further over the intermeeting period. 
-0.5	In contrast, participants thought that fiscal policy was exerting significant near-term restraint on the economy. 
-0.5	In the March Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, respondents reported that leveraged investors seemed to have become somewhat more willing to take positions in risky assets since December.
-0.5	In January and February, increases in average hourly earnings for all employees continued to be subdued.
-0.5	One participant highlighted that hiring rates and quit rates remained somewhat low. 
-0.5	Other participants, however, saw little evidence that the efficacy of asset purchases had declined over time, and a couple of these suggested that the effectiveness of purchases might even have increased more recently, as the easing of credit constraints allowed more borrowers to take advantage of lower interest rates. 
0.0	Ms. 
-0.5	By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. 
-0.5	The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. 
0.0	:
-0.5	In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised down somewhat in the near term, largely reflecting the federal spending sequestration that went into effect on March 1 and the resulting drag from reduced government purchases. 
0.5	Starts of multifamily units declined, on balance, but permits rose, consistent with additional gains in construction in coming months. 
-0.5	Some observers have suggested that a lengthy period of low long-term rates could encourage excessive risk-taking that could have adverse consequences for financial stability at some point in the future. 
-0.5	The Manager also reported on developments in foreign money markets and implications for the assets that the Federal Reserve holds in its foreign currency portfolio. 
-0.5	The Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook. 
-0.5	Several others thought that if the outlook for labor market conditions improved as anticipated, it would probably be appropriate to slow purchases later in the year and to stop them by year-end. 
-0.5	The information reviewed at the March 19-20 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate in the first quarter of this year after the slowdown late last year. 
0.5	In February, nominal retail sales, excluding those at motor vehicle and parts outlets, increased at a strong rate, while light motor vehicle sales edged up. 
-0.5	Fourth-quarter earnings per share for S&P 500 firms were estimated to have increased modestly from the previous quarter.
-0.5	It was also noted that were the outlook to deteriorate, the pace of purchases could be increased. 
-0.5	In light of this discussion, the Committee included language in the statement to be released following the meeting in part to make explicit that the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases were conditional not only on the likely efficacy and costs of those purchases, but also on the extent of progress toward the Committee's economic objectives.
-0.5	Several participants stated that such risks should not inhibit the Committee from pursuing its mandated objectives for inflation and employment. 
0.0	Tarullo, and Janet L. 
-0.5	The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
-0.5	In late February, these yields declined notably following the inconclusive election outcomes in Italy but mostly retraced this decline as economic data releases in subsequent weeks exceeded expectations. 
-0.5	The staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth was little changed, on balance, as the effects of somewhat more fiscal policy restraint and a higher assumed path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar were essentially offset by a brighter outlook for domestic energy production and a higher projection for household wealth, which reflected upward revisions to the projected paths for both equity prices and home prices. 
0.5	Real personal consumption expenditures rose modestly in January. 
-0.5	In this regard, several participants noted that a decision by the Committee to hold its MBS to maturity instead of selling them would essentially eliminate this risk. 
-0.5	Recent price developments were consistent with subdued inflation pressures and inflation remaining at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium run.
